       "array(['FADE IN on the words CZECH AIRLINE. We are panning across the words on the side of the plane. INT. AIRPLANE ANGLE DOWN on a tray table. Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. Hands are counting the money. The airline hostess announces the arrival at JFK - in CZECH. A hand reaches into a breast pocket - pulling out two passports. One is opened. Belongs to EMIL SLOVAK. The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to him. We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a small disposable camera on Oleg\\'s tray table. The passport is set down. Oleg picks it up. We hear Emil\\'s voice in CZECH. The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH. EMIL (V.O.) Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don\\'t open your mouth. OLEG (V.O.) Okay. INT. PASSPORT CONTROL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY CAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers. They are split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for visitors. CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK. An unshaven Czech in his mid-30\\'s. Tall, scraggly beard. Piercing blue eyes. He\\'s dressed in an outdated suit. His eyes are alert, cunning and smart. OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil. Oleg is big. Not tall - but wide. A wrestler\\'s body. Emil looks at Oleg. (The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.) EMIL Don\\'t fool around. OLEG Okay. Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to take a picture of himself. EMIL Did you hear what I said? OLEG I want to document my trip to America. IMMIGRATION OFFICER Next. (Emil steps up) Could I see your documents, please? EMIL Yes sir. He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an image swipe. Emil glances furtively back to Oleg. IMMIGRATION OFFICER What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States? EMIL Two weeks holiday. IMMIGRATION OFFICER How much money are you carrying with you? EMIL I have five-hundred dollars. IMMIGRATION OFFICER Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area! Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration Officer. Oleg puts the camera away. Smiles sheepishly. IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT\\'D) (to Emil) Is he with you? Are you travelling together? EMIL Yes. IMMIGRATION OFFICER Please join us. (to Oleg) Come on forward. EMIL Is there a problem? IMMIGRATION OFFICER No, you\\'re travelling together. I want to talk to you together. Hi, how are you? Can I take a look at your documents? (takes Oleg\\'s passport) Are you related? OLEG Yes...he\\'s my friend. IMMIGRATION OFFICER Okay. You\\'re a Czech national and you\\'re a Russian national. How do you know one another? Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off. EMIL We are both from Prague. IMMIGRATION OFFICER (to Oleg) How long are you planning to stay? EMIL Two weeks. IMMIGRATION OFFICER I\\'d like to speak for himself, okay? EMIL He doesn\\'t speak English. OLEG I speak English. IMMIGRATION OFFICER (to Oleg) Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you\\'re here? OLEG New York. IMMIGRATION OFFICER Yes, we\\'re in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York? OLEG A cheap hotel. IMMIGRATION OFFICER What are you coming here to do? OLEG I\\'m here for movies. IMMIGRATION OFFICER Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies? OLEG Yes. No. Both. When I was a boy, I see movie at school called \"It\\'s a Wonderful Life\" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white. IMMIGRATION OFFICER Excuse me? EMIL He made joke, bad joke. First time on airplane... The SUPERVISOR comes over to see what the problem is: IMMIGRATION OFFICER Well, they\\'ve got valid visas, but they don\\'t have much money. Uh... and I\\'m not...uh, I think there\\'s a possibility they may be coming to live and reside. SUPERVISOR Look how long the line is. We gotta move \\'em out. I\\'ll take them down to secondary. Emil looks at Oleg, pissed. INT. P.B. HERMAN\\'S RESTAURANT - DAY The place is empty except for one table at the end of the bar. EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan\\'s most famous detective, and his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails. Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired. Not only is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen, he\\'s continually mentioned in New York columns and has been the subject of several magazine articles. There\\'s even been a TV movie about one of his biggest cases. Leon has been with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie. Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star reporter for the tabloid show, \"Top Story.\" Hawkins is also the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ. Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up. Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a \"war story\" and a vodka tonic at the same time. EDDIE So we\\'re waitin\\' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin\\' by - ready to go. I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car. I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin\\'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it\\'s over. If I hadn\\'t gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would\\'ve had my head blown off. HAWKINS Jesus Christ. PAULIE, the owner, walks up. PAULIE Speakin\\' of bad habits, everybody okay? HAWKINS Another martini. LEON Coffee for me, I gotta slow down. EDDIE Vodka tonic. LEON (rethinks it) Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell? Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of vodka. LEON (CONT\\'D) (of Eddie\\'s story) It was freaky, I\\'ll tell you. Stupid kid. EDDIE What\\'s the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I\\'m not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin\\' his dog or buyin\\' a quart of milk. Who knows? But some kid\\'s robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can\\'t tell if he\\'s a piece of beef or a human being and I\\'m thinkin\\' that\\'s me. Sooner or later. That\\'s me. HAWKINS Sooner or later that\\'s everybody. EDDIE Not chopped up. Not chopped up like that. I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles. A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore. HAWKINS I think you\\'re getting a little moody there, Eddie. EDDIE I\\'m not moody. Hawkins and Leon share a look. HAWKINS Isn\\'t he a little moody? LEON Of course he\\'s moody. He thinks he\\'s in love. HAWKINS In love? With who? Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table. Takes a seat next to Eddie. Eddie asks Hawkins. EDDIE How old are your kids? HAWKINS My kids? Let\\'s see...Susan\\'s 15. Aundrea\\'s 9. Don\\'t tell me you\\'re thinking about having a kid! How old are you? Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole... (beat) It\\'s all true! Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit. Now -- I get it. Am I right, Leon? LEON Absomotherfuckin\\'lutely. You can have all three of my ex-wives. But somebody so much as looks sideways at my four girls -- I\\'d kill \\'em. (takes out his wallet) You haven\\'t seen my youngest have you? As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings. LEON (CONT\\'D) Yeah? HAWKINS Paulie, you\\'ve got kids, right? PAULIE My kids don\\'t talk to me anymore but they were great when they were young. LEON (into the phone) Sure it\\'s him? Great! (collapses the phone) Unique\\'s home. They all rise from the table. EDDIE Paulie, I need the cure. PAULIE Step into my office. Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave. HAWKINS So you got your kids listening to Opera? You still singing in the church on the weekends? INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg. They\\'ve been there a while. The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg. SECONDARY OFFICER Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that. (to Emil) And what kind of work do you do? EMIL I am butcher. SECONDARY OFFICER You\\'re a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for? EMIL You stuff sausage in it. SECONDARY OFFICER And what do you do with the bones? EMIL Dog food. Emil looks at Oleg. Blaming his stupid responses at Passport Control for their detainment. SECONDARY OFFICER Are you married? EMIL No. Are you proposing? ANGLE UP through a thousand ICE CUBES. A face plunges towards us... INT. MENS ROOM Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink full of ice. He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot eyes. Presents a small black ring box to the mirror. EDDIE Will you marry me? Wanna get married? What are you doin\\' Saturday? Leon enters. Eddie turns. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) I\\'m gonna propose. LEON When? EDDIE Tomorrow. At lunch. LEON You ready? Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes. Turns. EDDIE The thrill of the hunt. I love it. EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop action. Each stands with an old suitcase. OLEG (in Russian) Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies! EMIL (in Czech) Don\\'t speak Russian! OLEG (in Russian) Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech? EMIL (in Czech) Because I don\\'t like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school! Now speak Czech or English. And don\\'t fool around anymore. You almost got us thrown out! Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos\\' address on it. This is who they came to see. Emil hails a CAB. Oleg is staring inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor. A videocamera\\'s pointed out in the street. OLEG Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision. EMIL We have no money. Come on. Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this. Emil slides into the cab. CABBIE Where you wanna go, buddy? Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope. Points to the return address on it and passes it through the slot to the Cabbie. EMIL Here. Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg. Then, Oleg hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his coat. He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut and jumps in the back seat. He opens his jacket - pulling out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Go! Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil. EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - DAY Eddie\\'s car pulls up. Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out. HAWKINS So what\\'s unique? EDDIE Not what. Who. Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed - covered in blood. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) He\\'s from Antigua. His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party. Stabbed her with a beer bottle. HAWKINS That\\'s unique. EDDIE Yeah. And he still went to the party. Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty. LOOKOUT Top floor. Back room. EDDIE Yeah. I make big cases, they make the news and I look good. But the problem with becoming a star is downtown. They shoot at stars. Now be quiet. Shhh. As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads. Waves them off. They hurry away. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) I hope this prick doesn\\'t run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me. HAWKINS You\\'re worried for my safety. I\\'m touched. Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend the fire escape. HAWKINS (CONT\\'D) Ready? EDDIE Keep them out of my way. HAWKINS Okay. You ready? EDDIE Yeah, yeah. Jesus. Eddie closes in. HAWKINS (into his cell phone) COME ON! COME ON! YOU FUCKING GUYS, LET\\'S MOVE IT! Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley. Where he lands dropping his gun. Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up. EDDIE What\\'s your rush? Going to a party? UNIQUE Why you chasin\\' me, man? EDDIE I don\\'t know. You always come outta your house that way? UNIQUE It\\'s not my house, man. I don\\'t live here. EDDIE Well, sounds like burglary to me. Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie. UNIQUE I know you man. An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene. Disgorges a mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust. HAWKINS (to Eddie) Any chance we can do that again? EDDIE Again? I didn\\'t wanna do it the first time. EXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone. Oleg gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope into his jacket, then steps up to the old building. He looks back at Oleg - who\\'s VIDEOTAPING him. EMIL Turn that off! Get the bags. OLEG Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog. EMIL For five years I paid for your stupidness - you\\'ll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so. (challenging) Unless you refuse, Oleg. Oleg looks at Emil. Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil, he fears him. He picks up both bags. Emil searches the occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building. EMIL (CONT\\'D) There. 5RW. Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW. A BUZZER clicks and Emil pushes it open. INT. MILOS\\' APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the stairs... Oleg cradling his camera. Emil notices a crack pipe on the floor and picks it up. Smells the bowl. OLEG What? EMIL Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs. Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving down the dirty hallway to a corner door. INT. MILOS\\' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach. The door is opened by MILOS - a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls. He is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway. Oleg films him... MILOS Emil???! EMIL Surprise! Surprise! Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his comely wife. INT. MILOS\\' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Emil pushes his way inside. Oleg follows. Milos wears plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex. Tamina has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace, bracelet and big pearl earrings. The room is furnished with kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas. The only anomaly is a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER. (The following is in Czech and subtitled in English.) EMIL Your sister said she didn\\'t know where you were so you shouldn\\'t write to her with return address if you\\'re hiding. MILOS Did you hurt her? EMIL You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where\\'s the money? OLEG Hello, Tamina. Oleg is looking Tamina over. Milos - though scared - barks at Oleg. MILOS Take your eyes off her, Oleg! (to Emil) Look. It wasn\\'t my fault you two were caught. (of Oleg) It\\'s his fault. Trying to get the bank clerk\\'s phone number?! I wasn\\'t going to wait!!! EMIL Milos. Get my money! Oleg videotapes the scene. CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR All we see behind it is a WOMAN\\'S FACE and her wet hair - she obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped around her. MILOS (nervously) We spent it! EMIL Ha. Ha. MILOS Look at the way we live. I\\'m a plumber. You think I\\'d be working if I had money?! Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN KNIFE. He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her throat. MILOS (CONT\\'D) Emil. Put down the knife. Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified. MILOS (CONT\\'D) Emil. I\\'ll help you. Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm him by talking softly. MILOS (CONT\\'D) I can get you a job. EMIL A job? MILOS Yes, the money is good. EMIL As a plumber?! MILOS It\\'s easy to learn. EMIL A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work! MILOS We started over, you can too. EMIL (furious) You spent all the money while I was in prison? Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!? Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily PLUNGES it toward Milos\\' chest! Oleg videotapes it. Then lowers the camera - shocked that Emil killed Milos. Blood sprays Tamina\\'s face. She tries to run but Oleg grabs her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the floor. He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at Emil who STABS Tamina - absolutely enraged! THE WOMAN BEHIND THE DOOR flees...Emil hears NOISE in the bedroom - a window opening. Emil kicks the bedroom door open. Sees the window leading to the fire escape. He dashes to it. Sees four flights down - the WOMAN, wearing a summer dress. Barefoot. Her hair still wet. She looks up. She is beautiful and terrified. She runs down the alley. EMIL (CONT\\'D) She saw! Emil hurries toward the bathroom. She just got out of the shower. Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair. Emil grabs the purse. Finds a CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PASSPORT. He opens the cover, stares at her photo and name. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Daphne Hanlova. There\\'s one stamp in the passport - from the U.S. when she arrived - June 16, 1998. Underneath is written - 6 MONTH STAY. Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all blank pages. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Six month visa. Still here two years later. They\\'ll deport her if she goes to Police. Emil pockets Daphne\\'s passport and wallet, scoops up her shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the floor. He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans and bottles aside. OLEG What are you looking for? Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies. EMIL I\\'m going to make a bohemian barbecue. Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into darkness. EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT A face comes from the darkness. It\\'s an athletically handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us. He\\'s in a tie and jacket in Central Park at NIGHT. He is JORDAN (JORDY) WARSAW. A sensitive man of rugged honesty. He runs down the hill in a hurry. A MUGGER steps in his path. MUGGER Got any spare change? How \\'bout a spare twenty? JORDY Look, I don\\'t have time for you, get out of my way!! MUGGER Alright, how \\'bout all your fuckin\\' money? The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm behind his back. With his other hand, Jordy whips out a BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind the mugger\\'s head. Jordy displays his shield. JORDY Okay, you\\'re under arrest! Now you happy? MUGGER Fire Department? Firemen don\\'t carry guns. JORDY Oh yeah? Guess again. Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger\\'s coat pockets - pulling out a handful of driver\\'s licenses and credit cards. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Nice - how many people you ripped off tonight?! Get up! As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his BEEPER goes off. JORDY (CONT\\'D) You couldn\\'t listen to me, could you? Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree. Cuffs him so his face is pressed up against the bark. JORDY (CONT\\'D) I\\'ll send a cop back for you. MUGGER Hey. C\\'mon, you can\\'t leave me like this. Some freak\\'ll come by and stab me! Jordy jogs off across the park. MUGGER (CONT\\'D) Wait! Come back!! EXT. MILOS\\' APARTMENT - NIGHT FIRE TRUCKS from three battalions. Radios CRACKLE. There\\'s a crowd growing. Jordy pushes his way through. The top floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been reduced to smoking ruins. The trees are covered in debris and soot. Jordy moves to LOUIE - Battalion Chief. LOUIE Lieutenant - take up your line and relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top floor. JORDY Hey, Louie, were you first due? LOUIE Yeah, I radioed you guys right away \\'cause you got two roasts on the top floor but you don\\'t hafta investigate cause homicide is up there. JORDY Homicide? Who let them up? I didn\\'t make it a crime scene yet. LOUIE Hey, it\\'s Eddie Flemming. KORFIN (O.S.) Yo, Jordy! BOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a turnout coat. KORFIN (CONT\\'D) Where you been, man? We got a celebrity! JORDY I heard. Who the hell let them up there? KORFIN I don\\'t know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph? JORDY You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious? KORFIN Naw - I\\'m sure the suspect\\'s not here. JORDY Oh yeah, why? KORFIN \\'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now! INT. MILOS\\' APARTMENT - NIGHT The roof is gone. The sky is exposed. It\\'s charred ruins, smoked beams and watery muck. Eddie and Leon are standing by what\\'s left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina\\'s charred bodies. Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar, listening to Leon. LEON So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine position - that they were doin\\' each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got fried. What do you think, Eddie? Jordy enters - with Korfin who\\'s carrying a paint can. EDDIE I don\\'t know. We got the experts here. Show them what you found - I hope you don\\'t mind, we came over to see if we could help. Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the celebrity. KORFIN Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie. JORDY Could you put out the cigar? Part of the job is picking up scents. EDDIE Oh, sure. Eddie puts his cigar out. Carefully slides it into a cigar holder and pockets it to finish later. LEON Well, I found - check it out - crack pipe. Looks like they got careless. Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs. Korfin shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe. LEON (CONT\\'D) Mind not shining that light in my eyes? KORFIN Sorry, bro. JORDY Hey, that\\'s great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don\\'t mind if we go through the routine? It gives us somethin\\' to do. EDDIE No, we don\\'t mind. You mind Leon? LEON No. Go ahead. JORDY Thanks. Appreciate it. Jordy throws a look at Korfin. Homicide detectives have no respect for fire marshals\\' investigative skills. Eddie rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes. KORFIN Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got good patterns - about thirty minutes old. Jordy moves to one of the corpses. He pulls on a white rubber glove. Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth. The glove comes out white. JORDY Mouth\\'s clean, too. KORFIN Clean? JORDY Don\\'t blow your nose! Jordy\\'s looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose. JORDY (CONT\\'D) The smoke\\'ll permeate your nostrils - burn \\'em out. Let it run. KORFIN But you knew that, right? Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief. Jordy turns back to the corpses on the bed. Eddie - in the other room - has found Tamina\\'s brushed gold bracelet on the floor. JORDY So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up? LEON That\\'s what it looks like to me. JORDY And while they\\'re burning up, they\\'re still goin\\' down on each other? You got to hand it to them. LEON (realizes he\\'s wrong - blows it off) Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight. Leon watches Jordy, quietly. With a pair of tweezers, Jordy pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the heads. Korfin supplies the paint can. Jordy drops the cloth inside. LEON (CONT\\'D) What was that? JORDY Evidence. Of a homicide. That got Eddie\\'s attention and he comes back to the bedroom. JORDY (CONT\\'D) You know what that is, right? EDDIE No, what is it? JORDY Why don\\'t you explain it, Bobby. (to a fireman joking a wall) Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor? CAMELLO No problem. (to Eddie and Leon) Excuse me, gentlemen. You might wanna back up a little more. Don\\'t wanna get your pants wet. Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV set. Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon. As Camello hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the bodies and Korfin explains: KORFIN They have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren\\'t breathin\\' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed. To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident. Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for something. LEON What\\'s he looking for? EDDIE A timer. Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up - on the other end is a timer. Korfin takes the timer from Jordy and moves to Eddie. KORFIN Here you go. A big double homicide. EXT. MILOS\\' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is arriving. Jumps out. Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin\\'s car. They open the trunk. Take off their muddy boots throwing them in. KORFIN You see Eddie\\'s face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it. JORDY He knew all along. KORFIN What?? JORDY That\\'s why he was so quiet. He was testing us. Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer inside. NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her microphone at Eddie. She\\'s smart, aggressive and respected by her peers. NICOLETTE Detective, does it look like a murder? EDDIE We don\\'t know that yet. It\\'s much too early. There\\'s a lot to be done. NICOLETTE How many victims are up there? EDDIE There are two bodies found at this point. NICOLETTE Can we go up to the crime scene? EDDIE You know you can\\'t do that. C\\'mon. NICOLETTE Is it drug related? EDDIE We don\\'t know. When I have more I\\'ll let you know. Nicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on Eddie\\'s hand. She barrels on... NICOLETTE Detective...what\\'s that you\\'re holding in your hand? Evidence? Mike pans up to Eddie\\'s face. Other reporters arrive, hurling questions which Eddie easily answers. Cameras flash as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy. Jordy is about to get in the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE HANDLOVA. She\\'s still wearing the crumpled summer dress. She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy. He only catches a glimpse of her. He starts toward her -- knifes through the crowd - but Daphne is gone. KORFIN What? JORDY There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us. She looked scared. Oh shit! Oh no! EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER Korfin\\'s car SCREECHES to a stop. Jordy leaps out. Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is now NAKED! MUGGER You motherfuckin\\' bastard! She stripped me! It was a bag lady! She touched me all over, it was disgusting. Jordy unlocks the handcuffs. JORDY I\\'m sorry. I\\'m really sorry. Korfin delivers a blanket. Jordy covers him. JORDY (CONT\\'D) You okay? MUGGER A dog pissed on me!! I\\'m gonna sue you for this! You violated my civil rights! JORDY Your civil rights?! You tried to rob me! I could arrest you right now! You\\'re lucky you\\'re walking away from this. Now get outta here. Jordy gives him a push. The Mugger wraps the blanket around himself cursing - hurrying away. EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a sleazy hotel. CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign. INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into the room. Emil is at the window pulling the blind down trying to shut out the blinking light. He pulls it down twice and it pops back up both times. The third time he angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely. He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow behind his back. THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV. Roseanne has been talking to a FATHER. ROSEANNE (ON T.V.) So you slept with your son\\'s wife! What\\'s that all about? FATHER (ON T.V.) I take full responsibility for sleepin\\' with my daughter in law. I had low self esteem, I thought I had to compete with him. Emil reaches for his dictionary. EMIL (mutters) Self-esteem? Self-esteem?? He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self esteem. FATHER (ON T.V.) Losin\\' my job and everything, caused my behavioral disorder. (turns to his son) Forgive me, Kirk. Let me hug you? The audience boos. Roseanne mediates... Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera\\'s LCD screen - rewinding Milos\\' murder. We see it now for the first time - as he rewinds it. Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka between his legs. Emil, looks up from his dictionary. He\\'s wearing Milos\\' Rolex. Tamina\\'s jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl earrings - are in front of him with Daphne\\'s wallet. Emil looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera. EMIL (Czech) Turn that fucking thing off! OLEG (Czech) I\\'m not filming. I\\'m watching Milos die. It\\'s just like a move but realer. Emil grabs the videocamera. (Czech) Don\\'t break it! Don\\'t break it! EMIL Speak English! OLEG (English) You said speak Czech! EMIL How you erase this? OLEG I\\'ll do it. Don\\'t hurt my camera! Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka bottle in order to catch the camera. Oleg, holding the camera like it\\'s gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away. Emil starts to go through Daphne\\'s wallet. EMIL Stupid, Milos. I didn\\'t want to kill him. (noticing) What\\'s this? Emil found the last card in the wallet. It\\'s pink with a picture of a busty globe. Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY ESCORTS - and a number. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Worldly escorts? Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages - finding the meaning of worldly. He gets up and dials the number. A soft, SEXY VOICE answers. Soft music in the background. SEXY VOICE Hi? EMIL Hello? SEXY VOICE Are you looking for companionship? Oleg, who\\'s listening, moves to Emil. OLEG Whore? EMIL I\\'m homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl? SEXY VOICE Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech girl. EMIL I take her. Send her! EXT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT Korfin\\'s car pulls up to the station - as a fire engine is returning. JORDY Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him. KORFIN Yeah? JORDY Maybe you can be his stand-in. INT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT The men are pulling off their equipment - coming down from the high of fighting a fire. Korfin and Jordy walk toward the TV room. The TV is on in the background. We can see Nicolette interviewing Eddie. He holds up the paint can. CHIEF DUFFY (O.S.) What the hell is that?? You gave Eddie Flemming the evidence?! They turn. DEPUTY CHIEF FIRE MARSHAL DECLAN DUFFY - the head of the arson squad - comes over. Duffy\\'s tough, Irish and very political. DUFFY (pointing to the TV) Who did cause and origin? JORDY Who do you think, Chief?! DUFFY Then why didn\\'t you talk to the reporter? JORDY \\'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it. They walk to the back of the station and start up the stairs. DUFFY Don\\'t you guys understand? It\\'s all about image. The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime. KORFIN Yeah, right. DUFFY What was that, Korfin? KORFIN I said, yeah, you\\'re right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin\\' we\\'ll let you alert the media. DUFFY You do that, wiseguy. Now let\\'s solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does. They all head upstairs. INT. ARSON SQUAD ROOM - DAY The Chief, Jordy and Korfin enter. There are posters of pyros, arsonists and terrorists on the walls. GARCIA - a Puerto Rican investigator - looks up from his desk. GARCIA Hey guys, I got your torch. He just gave a full confession. A scruffy, unshaven white man sitting across from Garcia, turns. He is MAX, a pyromaniac in his 40\\'s with a freshly scratched cross etched in his forehead. He craves attention. MAX It\\'s my fire! Screw homicide. I\\'ll tell you guys everything! Jordy moves to his desk with Korfin. They sit across from each other. Duffy keeps going to his office, not even bothering to stop. JORDY What\\'s that on your forehead, Max? That\\'s a nice attention getter. MAX Yeah, I\\'m religious. I\\'m not an Atheist like you! Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not? JORDY How did you start the fire this time? MAX I used an accelerant. JORDY Yeah? What kind? MAX (to Jordy) Hey, by the way, I\\'m really sorry about your wife leavin\\' you. KORFIN Max. MAX (continuing) ...Yeah, and with your old man dying last year you - what\\'s it? Just you and the dog now? KORFIN Max! MAX Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy your ex-wife\\'s seeing - I hear he\\'s a big shot downtown. Jordy pops out of his seat. JORDY That\\'s it! You\\'re outta here. Jordy pulls Max by the collar - pushes him down the aisle. MAX That\\'s it. I\\'m suing. KORFIN Get in line. Korfin takes over - throwing him out. Jordy turns to Garcia who is laughing. JORDY What\\'s so funny. How does he know so much about me? Who tells him my life story? GARCIA He hangs around downstairs. The guys talk to him. He\\'s a joke... JORDY He\\'s no joke! One day he\\'s gonna graduate from trash can fires and do something big. GARCIA Okay. Okay. We\\'ll ban him from the station. INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT As the \"Top Story\" logo is splashed across the screen, accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces America\\'s highest rated \\'news magazine\\' show. ROBERT HAWKINS Good evening, I\\'m Robert Hawkins and this is Top Story. Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store. But now, Mr. Geller\\'s claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the victim. According to Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist. Hard to believe...watch. EMIL (O.S.) Louder. VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting on the hotel bed watching the TV. He looks at us. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Louder. Oleg\\'s hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the volume. The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew. He\\'s sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint stained shirt. A showing of his artwork is displayed in the background. Patients peruse the paintings of weird dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact. One of the paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson. STEPHEN GELLER This had nothing to do with shoes that didn\\'t fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor. ROBERT HAWKINS Your doctor? STEPHEN GELLER Yes. My psychiatrist didn\\'t insist that I stay on my medication. ROBERT HAWKINS ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people? STEPHEN GELLER It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I\\'m not morally responsible. My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of. How could I know. I\\'m not a doctor. ROBERT HAWKINS You seem very savvy for a man who\\'s been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. STEPHEN GELLER Look, I\\'m a victim here, too. I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I\\'ll never graduate. My life has been permanently disrupted. ROBERT HAWKINS Permanently disrupted? Aren\\'t you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money? Hasn\\'t this \\'incident\\' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist? STEPHEN GELLER Look, I\\'m in here. You call this a career move? ROBERT HAWKINS And isn\\'t there a movie in the works about you? STEPHEN GELLER We\\'re in negotiations, that\\'s correct. ROBERT HAWKINS But doesn\\'t the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes? STEPHEN GELLER That doesn\\'t apply to me because I\\'m not a criminal. I\\'m not a criminal! I wasn\\'t convicted. Emil leans forward - listening. Fascinated. EMIL I love America. No one is responsible for what they do. There\\'s a KNOCK on the door. Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over to it. Then WHIPS back to Emil. Emil looks at us. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Get in the bathroom! OLEG (O.S.) Whatever we do - we fuck her, right? EMIL Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up! Emil turns off the TV. Our POV backs into the bathroom, closing the door but leaving it open a crack. Emil looks down at his shoe. The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife sticking out of Emil\\'s BOOT. Emil\\'s hands pull his pants cuff over it. POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door and opens it. It\\'s not Daphne and she\\'s not world class. HONEY Hi, I\\'m Honey. EMIL Where\\'s Czech girl? HONEY Baby, I\\'m anybody you want me to be. I\\'m a little schoolgirl, I\\'m mommy, I\\'m a Czech girl. She enters. Closes the door behind her. HONEY (CONT\\'D) Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure. Why don\\'tchya put my money on the dresser. EMIL I ordered a Czech girl. Daphne, you know her? Oleg ZOOMS in for a CLOSE UP of Honey. During the rest of the scene Oleg films her. Honey begins to undress. HONEY It\\'s an outcall service run out of an apartment. I don\\'t meet the other girls. Aren\\'t you gonna get undressed? EMIL Where is escort service? HONEY That\\'s confidential. Could you put the money on the dresser? EMIL I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address? HONEY Look. Do we have a problem here? There\\'s no reason to have a problem. I\\'m gonna make you feel real good. You wanna Czech girl? After I\\'m done with you, you won\\'t miss her. Now why don\\'t you pay me? She starts to unfasten Emil\\'s belt. EMIL (stopping her) Listen to me. I don\\'t want sex. Just give me the address and then you go. HONEY (suddenly hard as nails) Look, man, I don\\'t give a shit if you want sex or not, but you\\'re payin\\' for my time. Emil pulls the knife out of his boot and SHOVES her against the door, PUSHING the blade against her throat - suddenly furious like he was before killing Milos and Tamina. EMIL Give me the address!! HONEY Alright, alright - don\\'t hurt me! Please, it\\'s in my book, in my purse! Emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out with a can of mace, SPRAYING Emil\\'s face! Emil stumbles backwards - Oleg holding him in the frame. He WHIP PANS back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking the door but Emil\\'s HAND SLAMS it shut! Emil turns blindly, rubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door. Honey darts toward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into Oleg who is VIDEOTAPING HER. Horrified, she turns around as Emil SMASHES her in the face so hard she topples backwards, tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on her! Like a panther out for the kill, Emil POUNCES. Oleg films as Emil lifts his hand, gripping... THE KITCHEN KNIFE As Emil\\'s hand comes FLYING DOWN - then RISES UP, BLOODIED. Her screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around her face. Oleg films the scene as the knife plunges DOWN INTO: INT. FIRE STATION 91 - ARSON SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT DAPHNE, a sketch of her face. JORDY (O.S.) Her lips are fuller than that. You can see \\'em a mile away. WIDER Food containers are scattered all over the place. The female COMPOSITE ARTIST looks at Jordy. Stacks of failed sketches sit beside her. COMPOSITE ARTIST What about her cheek bones? JORDY Her cheek bones are prominent and her eyes were huge. Big, blue eyes and when I saw her, she looked scared. Like she was looking to get away. But she was absolutely beautiful. The composite artist looks at Jordy. JORDY (CONT\\'D) I gotta good look at her. Korfin has his chair turned around from his desk and is watching the sketch evolve as he speaks on the phone to the landlord of the 7th Street brownstone. Garcia is also on the phone. The other investigators are gone. Working late into the night. Everybody\\'s exhausted. It\\'s almost dawn. KORFIN -- From Czechoslovakia? And how long have they been livin\\' in your building? (writes 4 YEARS on his pad) Alright, I\\'ll be in touch when we know somethin\\'. (to Jordy) Milos and Tamina Karlova. They were quiet and kept to themselves. Landlord don\\'t know who your girl is. JORDY How long they been livin\\' here? KORFIN You hear that question, Garcia? GARCIA Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone - they\\'ve been here illegally. KORFIN Well, they\\'re definitely permanent residents now. GARCIA I got the owner of the plumbing company Milos worked for. KORFIN Why don\\'t we get some sleep and we\\'ll go see him in the morning. JORDY You go home. I\\'m takin\\' your car and goin\\' back to the crime scene. KORFIN Aren\\'t you tired? JORDY If I go home I won\\'t be able to fall asleep anyway. Jordy takes the sketch of Daphne which isn\\'t a bad likeness and heads for the door. Korfin falls in behind him. As they pass Garcia he hands Jordy the address. KORFIN (of the picture) She keepin\\' you up? Like to meet her, huh? She\\'d make you forget your ex wife. Cure your insomnia. INT. MILOS\\' APARTMENT - DAWN CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters what is left of Milos and Tamina\\'s apartment. The roof has been burned off. He moves into the next room, trying to see through the darkness - looking through the muck and char. EDDIE Okay to smoke? Jordy turns, surprised. Eddie sits on a singed chair. He pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his \\'won ton soup\\' container, smoking a cigar. On the arm of the armchair is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the crime scene and the burned bodies. JORDY It\\'s your crime scene now. You can do what you want. EDDIE Watch the news? JORDY Nah, I musta missed it. EDDIE Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit. JORDY Well, just so you know, I don\\'t care about that stuff. EDDIE Nah, why should you? JORDY I don\\'t even watch TV. EDDIE Good. Good. Commendable. Eddie knocks his \\'won ton soup\\' back. JORDY Did you get a report from the M.E.? EDDIE Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me? JORDY If you found me steppin\\' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. (then) What about the report? EDDIE You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That\\'s usually an indicator of something personal. Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne. Hands it to Eddie. JORDY The Super said he\\'d seen her before but she didn\\'t live here. EDDIE Pretty. JORDY (acts as if he didn\\'t notice) Hmmmm. EDDIE Maybe you don\\'t care about that either. (beat) Prettiest suspect I\\'ve had in awhile. JORDY Who says she\\'s a suspect? Jordy tries to take the sketch back. Eddie holds on. EDDIE What would you call her? JORDY Look, I\\'m not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows? Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were. EDDIE Obviously they weren\\'t having sex. As you pointed out. So why go through all the trouble of putting \\'em like that? Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy. JORDY Maybe it\\'s a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it\\'s like condemning them to hell. EDDIE Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary? JORDY Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally. Eddie\\'s cellular rings - he grabs it. EDDIE Yeah? Where? You sure it was a knife? Uh-huh. Really? Okay. (to Jordy) We\\'ve got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue. A stabbing. Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian... Eddie\\'s moving with Daphne\\'s sketch. JORDY I\\'ll come with you. EDDIE There wasn\\'t a fire. There\\'ll be nothing for you to do. JORDY I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I\\'ll learn something. EDDIE This isn\\'t homicide school. JORDY My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle. EDDIE You\\'re Polish? JORDY My folks are. EDDIE Stay here. EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEWS STAND - DAY Video POV of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and picks up a copy of THE NEW YORK POST. Eddie\\'s photo is on the front page - holding the kitchen timer by the wires. Underneath his picture the caption reads, \"DOUBLE HOMICIDE... FLEMMING\\'S ON IT.\" The videocamera widens out revealing Emil standing in front of a Times Square news stand, reading the front page. The videocamera turns around - until focusing on Oleg himself. OLEG This is second day in America. First day was very exciting. Full of thrills and chills. Over there, is co-star of my new movie, Emil! He turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL. EMIL (to vendor) Who is he? VENDOR New York\\'s finest. This is his case. The VENDOR - picks up People. Stephen Geller is on the cover. VENDOR (CONT\\'D) This all you want? EMIL Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights? VENDOR (People) In here, says he wants a million. EMIL Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview? VENDOR Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview. And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her? It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not? EMIL Yes. Both. OLEG And these. Oleg picks up FILM COMMENT, MOVIELINE and PREMIERE magazine. Emil pays for everything. EMIL (to Oleg) Get a taxi. Oleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases and hails a taxi. As Emil collects his change he sees an old BLIND WOMAN waiting at the crosswalk. The light\\'s blinking WALK. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Let me help. Emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side. BLIND WOMAN Thank you, son. Emil watches her walk on. INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - DAY The hotel room is a hive of activity. GIL is dusting the dresser for prints. Another officer is stripping the bed and putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag. As Eddie enters the crime scene, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is standing in the doorway taking pictures. EDDIE Where is she? LEON Takin\\' a bath. EDDIE Any I.D.? LEON Still unknown but we\\'re running prints. Kid over there caught the case. Jordy enters. Leon steps in his way. LEON (CONT\\'D) Sorry...PD only. EDDIE It\\'s okay. Eddie walks over to a young detective. TOMMY CULLEN, only 26, is excited to meet Eddie. TOMMY Tommy Cullen. Heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you. Here\\'s what we got. A girl in there, figure her to be a prostitute, looks like she was fighting for her life. She\\'s got defense wounds on her hands. Right this way - in the bathroom. EDDIE After you. Eddie follows Tommy into the bathroom. There\\'s blood splattered all over the walls and the floor. Honey\\'s topless body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain. MURPHY, an Irish medical examiner (M.E.), is examining the body. TOMMY Room was registered to a Francis Capra. JORDY Capra? That\\'s not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian? TOMMY The clerk? EDDIE Check the switchboard, see what phone calls were made from this room. TOMMY I\\'ll do it. Tommy heads out. Eddie takes out his cigar holder. Slides out what\\'s left of his cigar. Re-lights it. Looks down at Honey\\'s body in the bathtub. Gil\\'s dusting the tub for prints. MURPHY Clothes were off in the other room. Tub is dry except for the blood. EDDIE Any of you guys take a piss lately? Gil looks confused. Eddie points to the toilet. Seat is up. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Do the seat for me. Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it. Eddie stands in the bathroom - studying the scene. Holding the unlit cigar. Looking around at the blood splattered walls. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Only one guys checked in? LEON Yeah. EDDIE C\\'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful. Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Our killer...our killer\\'s standing here slashing at her. She\\'s fightin\\' him. The blood is splattering this way. It\\'s on this wall... (pointing to the right of Jordy) And there\\'s some specks over here. (to the left of Jordy) There\\'s nothing here because someone was standing right here. Someone big. And he\\'s got blood on him. Lots of blood. He wouldn\\'t walk out of here like that. (turning to Murphy) Murphy, what kind of knife you think we\\'re talking about here? Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the blood-splattered wall. MURPHY If you look here where he missed and hit the wall you see that the marks aren\\'t deep but they\\'re kinda wide... not your everyday kitchen or pocket knife. EDDIE What if the tip was broken off? MURPHY Could be. Then we should find it here somewhere. EDDIE I think we\\'ve already found it. Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young detective, returns. TOMMY There was only one call from this room last night. I dialed it. It\\'s an escort service. LEON Did you identify yourself? TOMMY Hey, I\\'m new but I\\'m not stupid. EDDIE Call communications and get an address on that number. Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service address on it. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Good work. INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - STAIRS - DAY Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie. JORDY You goin\\' to the escort service? EDDIE You got any better ideas? JORDY Mind if I ride along with you? EDDIE This has nothing to do with your fire. JORDY But what if it does? You might need my help. As Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches. MAN Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for my son? EXT. KING EDWARD HOTEL - DAY Jordy catches up. Eddie finishes signing the autograph using the man\\'s back. EDDIE I\\'ll let you know what happens. JORDY This is ridiculous. I\\'m not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over. EDDIE Tell you what - I\\'ll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don\\'t win, you don\\'t come. JORDY I\\'ll call it... tails. Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy. EDDIE Okay. I\\'ll call it. Heads. Jordy flips the coin and it\\'s heads. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Heads. See, you lost twice. (beat) Okay. Get in. Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car. Before Jordy can get in, Eddie starts to pull away. Jordy stands on the sidewalk - dejected. Eddie stops the car again and this time lets Jordy get in. WHIP PAN TO: INT. UPPER EASTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY Eddie and Jordy arrive in front of Rose\\'s door. Eddie knocks and flips a coin to Jordy. EDDIE Oh here. A souvenir. Jordy takes the quarter. Not understanding what Eddie means. He looks at the quarter. JORDY Two heads. EDDIE Better than one. Eddie suckered him with the coin toss. Jordy reacts. Eddie laughs - squirts Binaca in his mouth. Knocks again. We hear ROSE HELLER. ROSE (O.S.) Who\\'s there? EDDIE Police. We\\'d like to ask you a few questions. ROSE (O.S.) I have nothin\\' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney... EDDIE (commands) Homicide, Miss Hearn. It\\'s Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up. Rose reacts. Immediately UNLOCKS, UNCHAINS and opens the door! ROSE You! I\\'ve seen you on TV! Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy. ROSE (CONT\\'D) C\\'mon in. C\\'mon in! INT. ROSE\\'S APARTMENT - DAY They enter. ROSE Just a minute. Shit. And I don\\'t have a camera. Hold on a second. Rose moves back to the phone - finishes up her conversation in Afrikaner. We hold on Eddie and Jordy at the door. Eddie looks around - taking in the place. FOUR GIRLS are on phones. Two girls take orders for customers. The other two work the phone sex lines. Rose hangs up the phone - turns to Eddie and Jordy: ROSE (CONT\\'D) What\\'s wrong? EDDIE We don\\'t have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel. ROSE Oh my G-d. Honey! Honey\\'s dead? JORDY Do you remember the man who called? Though Rose answers Jordy, she directs her response to Eddie. ROSE Yeah. He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey \\'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn\\'t really matter - Honey was killed...? Poor girl... EDDIE Do you have any Czech girls working for you? ROSE No. EDDIE Did you tell him you did? A BUTCH GIRL enters. Rose speaks to her in Afrikaner. ROSE (Afrikaner) Boy, she\\'s so popular all the sudden. EDDIE What are you saying? ROSE Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too. Jordy pulls out the sketch, unfolds it. JORDY This her? ROSE Yeah. Sort of. I tried to recruit her, gave her my card. She said she\\'d think about it but I never heard from her. BUTCH GIRL (Afrikaner) Beautiful eyes. EDDIE Who came by looking for her? ROSE He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here. EDDIE Describe him. ROSE Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler\\'s build. And he wouldn\\'t turn his videocamera off me. EDDIE He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly! ROSE She washes hair up at Ludwig\\'s - a salon on 63rd and Madison. EXT. EDDIE\\'S CAR - DAY As Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING. INT. EDDIE\\'S CAR - DAY Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with astonishing dexterity. This man can drive. Eddie picks up his phone - dials. Jordy is on his cell phone as well. EDDIE Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig\\'s. JORDY (overlapping) I\\'m on my way with Eddie. Ludwig\\'s. 63rd and Madison. The suspects might be there already. Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects. Eddie picks up a beer he was holding between his legs - finishes it. EDDIE You thirsty? JORDY I\\'m on duty. EDDIE (drinking) So am I. Alright, I\\'ll go inside and you cover the back. JORDY Of course. EDDIE Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling \\'Freeze!\\' at the bad guy! What\\'d you dream about? JORDY I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid. EDDIE Then I guess we\\'re doin\\' this the right way, aren\\'t we? If we pull up to a burning building I\\'ll gladly let you go first. Jordy looks at Eddie - can\\'t deny he\\'s right. INT. LUDWIG\\'S SALON - DAY We\\'re in a moving video POV of Ludwig\\'s, the hair salon - it\\'s big and spacious. The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST. OLEG (O.S.) Daphne Handlova? RECEPTIONIST Daphne? In the back. Probably shampooing a customer\\'s hair. Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye. LUDWIG, the owner, is with her. LUDWIG Why are you messing with your hair color again? You\\'re going to kill your hair. You won\\'t look good with black hair. DAPHNE I want to do it, alright? LUDWIG Well, then do it after work. A customer\\'s waiting. He leaves, a customer approaches. She smiles at him - turns on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her. She backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door! TO THE BACKYARD There\\'s a garden out there. Daphne runs toward the alley. Oleg follows her - still videotaping. As she rounds the corner she bumps into...Emil! He pulls out his kitchen knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with the broken tip against her throat. EMIL I...I have a temper. She looks at him, not understanding. Oleg films the scene. EMIL (CONT\\'D) When I lose it, I lose control. I didn\\'t intend to kill Milos but he stole from me. Cheated me! When I went to prison, they beat me. I still didn\\'t tell he was my partner. I loved Milos like a brother... The tone in Emil\\'s voice - there\\'s an uncharacteristic softness to it. He wants to reconcile his behavior to her. EMIL (CONT\\'D) (in English) I\\'m not a killer. The back door opens. He shoves the knife in his pocket as Ludwig peers around the alleyway. What he sees is Emil leaning close to Daphne, kissing her. LUDWIG Daphne, will you be coming back to work? DAPHNE In a minute, Ludwig. Ludwig leaves. EMIL Smart girl. I\\'m glad you\\'re not a whore. But washing hair? This is no job for a woman as beautiful as you. They should be washing your hair. Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it. EMIL (CONT\\'D) I don\\'t want to kill you. But if you talk, I will. (whispers) I thought you\\'d want these. He taps her hand...he turns and goes out the rear exit. Oleg follows. Jordy arrives. JORDY ...Daphne? She says nothing. JORDY (CONT\\'D) I\\'m a fire marshal. You remember me from the other night? You are Daphne, right? She says nothing. Eddie arrives. Daphne turns. Recognizing Eddie. EDDIE You don\\'t have to be afraid. We\\'re here to protect you. Come with me. We want to talk to you. You speak English alright? Eddie looks at Jordy. Takes Daphne by the arm. EXT. LUDWIG\\'S SALON - CONTINUOUS As they come out, Eddie notices Daphne clutching something in her hand. He reaches for her hand. Opens it. It\\'s a brushed gold necklace. EDDIE Did he give you these? Was he just here? Eddie searches the streets. Notices Oleg and Emil on the far corner. Oleg is videotaping him. Leon and Tommy pull up. Korfin behind. They all pop out. Eddie grabs Leon - squeezes his arm - quietly. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) The other side of the street. The guy with the videocamera. (back to Jordy) Don\\'t look - put her in the car. (to Leon) Stay this side. LEON (back to Tommy) Stay with her. They start heading down the curb - trying not to attract the attention of Oleg and Emil. A VIDEO CLOSE-UP of the scene from across the corner. EMIL (Czech) Put the fuckin\\' camera down! Let\\'s go! Emil starts to flee. EXT. NYC STREETS - CONTINUOUS What follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie, Jordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing Emil. Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of breath. EDDIE Split up! Jordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other. Korfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side. They search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around, missing him. Emil seems to have disappeared. Leon, gun raised, approaches the cafe. As he rounds the corner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face! Leon crashes into a table, dropping his gun. Emil scoops up the gun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon. BEATING the detective to a pulp. People are running from the scene. Emil takes Leon\\'s wallet. He is distracted by LAUGHTER. Oleg is VIDEOTAPING the scene. OLEG Emil, look! Oleg swivels with the videocamera. Korfin is running toward them - pushing through the crowd. Emil FIRES! Korfin is blown backwards. OLEG (CONT\\'D) Perfect! Cut. Print! Eddie arrives. Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with blood. Jordy runs to Korfin, who\\'s laying in the street, shot in the side. Jordy cradles his partner. EDDIE Are you hit? LEON No. I\\'m okay. JORDY (to Korfin) Bobby, Bobby! Where\\'re you hit?! KORFIN It hurts. Aw, Jesus! JORDY Lay down. Stay down, Bobby. Jordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street. Cars screech out of the way! Eddie crouches, taking aim at Emil, who is almost two blocks away. It\\'s an impossible shot, out of range. But Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT. Two blocks away, Emil topples. Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie, astonished he made the shot. Emil scrambles to his feet. Runs. Eddie holsters his weapon. Pulls out a handkerchief. Dabs Leon\\'s wounds. LEON He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time! EDDIE I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll get those fuckers. DISSOLVE TO: EMS VEHICLE Eddie and Jordy watch as Korfin on a stretcher, is loaded in an EMS VEHICLE and in b.g., an EMS DOCTOR attends to Leon\\'s bloody face. Eddie and Jordy turn to go back into the restaurant, now cleared out - as Nicolette Karas arrives with her cameraman. NICOLETTE Detective - can you tell us what happened here? EDDIE I can\\'t talk right now. We have some things to take care of. Jordy moves off, he doesn\\'t want to get pulled in front of Nicolette. Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant, maybe twenty feet away. Tommy stands next to her. This is where Eddie and Jordy are headed. NICOLETTE I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department? EDDIE I really can\\'t give out any information right now at this point. NICOLETTE Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson\\'s been injured. Is that correct? EDDIE He was hurt, but not seriously. He\\'ll be fine. NICOLETTE Do you have the suspect in custody? EDDIE Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson\\'s hurt. He\\'s fine. I\\'ve got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously. NICOLETTE (to cameraman) Alright, cut, cut, cut. Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his shoulder. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) (to Eddie) Eddie, are you okay? EDDIE Yeah. Now\\'s not a good time. NICOLETTE Alright. EDDIE Alright? NICOLETTE Alright. EDDIE Alright. NICOLETTE Okay. Eddie walks into the restaurant. Throws a look back at her, then enters. INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - DAY Jordy talks to Daphne. DAPHNE I told your partner, I can\\'t help. I didn\\'t see anything. EDDIE C\\'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people? DAPHNE Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs. EDDIE Go on. She says nothing. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Whether you tell us or not, we\\'ll find out. Better if it comes from you. DAPHNE If I tell you, will you arrest me? EDDIE Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you? She still hesitates. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) What are you hiding? Why are you afraid JORDY She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her. EDDIE Is that all there is? She looks at Eddie. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Are you here illegally? Don\\'t worry about that. We\\'ll talk to Immigration. They won\\'t deport you. DAPHNE No, no, don\\'t talk to Immigration! She clams up. JORDY Why not? EDDIE Something back home? Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits. Eddie sits across from her. Jordy crouches down next to her. DAPHNE ...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him. JORDY (optimistic) Alright. That\\'s a justifiable homicide. DAPHNE Yes, but he was a cop. EDDIE A cop? DAPHNE (beat) I\\'m from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled. EDDIE Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what\\'s happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth? DAPHNE You\\'re a cop - you\\'ll never believe me. JORDY (to Eddie) Can I talk to you? Eddie steps away with Jordy. Keeping his eyes on Daphne. She tries to listen. EDDIE She\\'s fucked. Even if that story is true. JORDY Raw deal. Eddie tilts his head. Measures Jordy. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they\\'re all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her. EDDIE You wanna talk to her alone? JORDY Yeah. EDDIE What would your girlfriend think of that? JORDY I don\\'t have a girlfriend. EDDIE My point exactly. JORDY I\\'m serious here. EDDIE So am I. JORDY C\\'mon. You intimidate her \\'cause you\\'re a celebrity. She sees me differently. EDDIE You\\'re her Savior? Is she the kid you\\'re gonna save from the burning building? JORDY You know what I\\'m saying here. Eddie looks at his watch. Thinks it over. Measures Jordy. EDDIE Okay, tell you what, I\\'ll give you a head start. You take her to the station house. Don\\'t let her out of your sight. She\\'s the only warm body we got left. JORDY Hey. I\\'m a professional. EDDIE Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs. He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door. INT. A SEEDY BATHROOM - DAY Emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of pink flesh taken out of his ankle. Emil grabs some toilet paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle. He grits teeth in pain. The lights go out. Then Oleg adjusts the fluorescent light above the sink. OLEG Gotta light the scene better. Now it\\'s more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN. EMIL Shut up. OLEG Does it hurt? Emil lifts his foot out of the sink. EMIL This is nothing. Emil lifts his shirt, exposing his back. OLEG Oh, shit. I hate looking at that! EMIL Don\\'t want to film this? We don\\'t see what Oleg sees - not yet - but from his expression, it\\'s horrible. INT. JORDY\\'S CAR - DAY Daphne rides in the backseat. Jordy\\'s watching her in the rearview. DAPHNE Now I become custody of police department? JORDY If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they\\'ll help you with your situation. DAPHNE I will if they don\\'t send me back. JORDY They won\\'t until this is over. She looks away. Out the window. Jordy sees emotion filling her eyes. She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up. DAPHNE Are you married? JORDY Divorced. DAPHNE Do you live alone? (beat) I\\'ve been in these clothes since...the killings. Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody? Jordy looks at her. Can\\'t quite tell if she\\'s trying to manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before all the shit starts. JORDY I can\\'t take you to my place. DAPHNE Somewhere else? Jordy looks at her... EDDIE Staring right at us. EDDIE I want to talk to you about something serious. He holds up the diamond engagement ring. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) I want to live the rest of my life with you...I don\\'t know you\\'ve been married before and I\\'ve never been married, but I do love you, and... Eddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the proposal. He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff. Leon\\'s blood. Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka tonic. PAULIE She\\'s here. Paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual. He hands Eddie the towel. Eddie wipes off his face and hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie. Paulie helps Eddie on with his coat. Eddie takes some Visine out of his coat pocket. Drops a few in each eye. HE straightens himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the drink. Eddie sets the glass down and starts out. Paulie hands him a Binaca. Eddie gives himself a squirt as he exits. Paulie follows. INT. P.B. HERMAN\\'S RESTAURANT - DAY It\\'s lunchtime...it\\'s crowded. Eddie takes a seat at a table. He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under the table. Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind. Gives him a kiss on the cheek. NICOLETTE Hey, honey. EDDIE Hey. She orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits down across the table. There\\'s a long pause - they just look at each other. NICOLETTE What is your problem? Why\\'d you snap at me? I just wanted a statement. EDDIE I can\\'t...I can\\'t answer you just because you want me to answer you! NICOLETTE You didn\\'t have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could give me something. EDDIE Oh, I\\'m sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh... NICOLETTE Stop it. EDDIE Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out? NICOLETTE Alright, alright, Eddie. Don\\'t patronize me. EDDIE I\\'m not. NICOLETTE Yes you are. I\\'m not just some reporter. I don\\'t just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something. EDDIE Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was... NICOLETTE That was good. You were holding the evidence. EDDIE You were merciless. You didn\\'t give a shit if you got me or not. NICOLETTE Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh? EDDIE You\\'re ruthless. NICOLETTE You\\'re not so bad yourself. They look at each other. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) C\\'mere. They kiss. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it? EDDIE Could be Leon\\'s. NICOLETTE Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you? Eddie takes her hand. EDDIE You know, I been thinkin\\'...these shoes might look nice with another pair of shoes next to them in the closet. She looks at him. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) You know, Nicky, I\\'ve been married twice before. My first wife was a professional woman, didn\\'t have time for children. My second wife...I never wanted to go home to her. Nicolette\\'s phone rings. Eddie stops - looks at the ringing phone. NICOLETTE What are you doing? What are you saying? Nicolette\\'s phone keeps ringing. Eddie stares at it. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) Eddie? Nicolette\\'s phone keeps ringing. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) Don\\'t worry about the damn phone. I won\\'t answer it. EDDIE Answer the phone. NICOLETTE No. Tell me what you want to say. EDDIE Answer it. NICOLETTE Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a second. They only call me when it\\'s an emergency. Just hold that thought. (into the phone) Can you call back? PHONE VOICE (O.S.) We need you here in twenty minutes. Get in a cab. NICOLETTE What\\'re you talking about? PHONE VOICE (O.S.) Katie. We don\\'t know where she is. We can\\'t find her. You gotta anchor the 5:00. This is your shot. Come now. NICOLETTE What? Oh. Okay. Yeah. The line disconnects. She collapses the phone. Turns to Eddie. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight! EDDIE That\\'s good. NICOLETTE Yeah. EDDIE Well, that\\'s great. NICOLETTE Okay. That is great. But I can\\'t go now, we\\'re in the middle of something here. EDDIE No. Go ahead. You\\'re gonna be great. NICOLETTE No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you\\'re talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and... EDDIE I\\'ll tell you tonight. Let\\'s do it tonight. As soon as you get back we\\'ll talk. We\\'ll talk. NICOLETTE Promise? EDDIE I promise. We\\'ll talk. You\\'ll be great. You\\'ll be fine. Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you\\'re talking to me. NICOLETTE Yeah. I\\'ll do that. As long as you\\'re not patronizing me. EDDIE Patronizing you... Nay, I love you. NICOLETTE I love you. They kiss. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) Okay, til tonight. EDDIE Tonight. NICOLETTE You promise? EDDIE Yeah. I promise. NICOLETTE Okay. And you know what, I\\'ll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How\\'s that... Would that be a good thing. EDDIE Yeah, yeah. Good thing. NICOLETTE Okay. EDDIE See you later. Good luck. NICOLETTE Thank you. EDDIE Don\\'t be late. She walks out. INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DAY Jordy unlocks the door. Enters with Daphne. The fire station is empty. JORDY The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires. DAPHNE So...the station is empty? JORDY Yeah. This way. He gestures toward the stairs. INT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room. Her eyes never leaving Jordy\\'s. JORDY You considered becoming a prostitute? DAPHNE Yes, I considered it. JORDY Did you ever turn tricks before? DAPHNE No. JORDY What about back home? DAPHNE No. Daphne stops. Looks at him. Stands very close. DAPHNE (CONT\\'D) I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn\\'t get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could\\'ve made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it\\'s not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig\\'s. JORDY So you were never a prostitute? DAPHNE What are you asking me? JORDY I\\'m just trying to find out who you are. She looks up into his eyes. Searching. Thinking he\\'s hinting. DAPHNE Can you let me go? She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to kiss her. Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie\\'s warning and backs up slightly. JORDY Showers are this way. Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even closer. DAPHNE You could shower with me. Jordy is locked in her eyes. Almost giving in. Then breaks away. Gestures towards the showers. Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen. She heads to the showers. Jordy follows her into the bathroom. The walls are lined with shower stalls. JORDY I\\'ll uh, I\\'ll get you a towel. He leaves her there. Alone. She quickly moves to the window. Opens it. Looks down. It\\'s a two-story drop to the street. JORDY gets a towel from the locker room. His beeper goes off. He checks the number but decides not to return the call. We follow him back into the bathroom. The shower is on but he notices the window. It\\'s open. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Shit! He rushes over. He looks out. No sign of her. He turns - looks back at the shower. It\\'s on but he can\\'t see through the curtain. Can\\'t tell if she\\'s there. He walks over - quickly - fearing that she\\'s left. He pulls the curtain aside. She\\'s crouched in the corner shower stall. Holding herself. She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Are you alright? Jordy sits on the bench next to the shower. DAPHNE I\\'m not a whore. I\\'m not a whore. JORDY I know. DAPHNE You don\\'t know. I\\'m sorry. I was desperate. That\\'s not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they\\'ll do to me when I got to prison? JORDY They\\'re not gonna send you right back. DAPHNE I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t mean to...I\\'m glad. Actually I\\'m glad it\\'s over. All this time. Hiding. Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was. Never trusting anyone... He covers her with the towel, pulling her up. JORDY You can trust me. She embraces him. Trusting him. He stands there for a moment. Then awkwardly holds her. Comforting her. INT. NYC RESTAURANT - DAY CLOSE UP on a steak. Male hands cut a piece. Another male hand sets down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin. The hands abandon the steak and rip open the bottle. The CAMERA pulls back to include the LCD screen of Oleg\\'s videocamera. He is taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his teeth. Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed over in pain. He \\'drinks\\' pills from the bottle and chews them up. Wincing in pain. Emil washes them down with a beer. Emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the \"People\" magazine article he\\'s reading on Stephen Geller. Emil laughs. Shaking his head at the article as the videocamera tilts back up to his face. OLEG What is it? EMIL The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it. OLEG I did. EMIL And the whore\\'s murder? You didn\\'t erase that either, did you? Don\\'t lie, I won\\'t be angry. OLEG Why not? EMIL Put the camera down, Oleg. Oleg closes the LCD screen and puts the camera down. Emil removes a small address book -- from Leon\\'s wallet - he looks up Eddie Flemming\\'s name. OLEG What is that? EMIL What does it look like? It\\'s an address book! Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book. OLEG Let me get a shot of it. EMIL Sit down! OLEG This way. Hold it this way. Good. Oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down. OLEG (CONT\\'D) Why won\\'t you be angry at me for keeping my movie? Emil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps away. Oleg follows. INT. PRECINCT - DAY It\\'s quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant\\'s desk. Looking at his watch. Growing more and more aggravated as every second ticks by. Jordy enters escorting Daphne. Sees Duffy and tires to go past him. Duffy turns and sees Jordy and Daphne. DUFFY Hey. Warsaw. Jordy stops and comes back. Sitting Daphne down on a bench. JORDY Hey, Chief, what are you doing here? DUFFY I came to see how the investigation was going. (looks at Daphne) I called and you\\'re not here. I wait up at the station and you don\\'t even show up!!! I beep you - you don\\'t return my call. Where the hell have you been?! Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne. JORDY Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up. DUFFY What do you mean, \\'cleaned up?\\' JORDY I let her take a shower. DUFFY A shower!? Did you take one, too? JORDY No! Nothing happened. DUFFY Oh really. That\\'s nice. You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot? Are you out of your fucking mind?? Are you having that much trouble gettin\\' dates?! EDDIE (O.S.) I told him to take her there. Jordy and Duffy turn. Eddie walks out. Eddie turns - Tommy - the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward Hotel - is coming out of the back office. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Tommy, get her outta here. Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct. TOMMY This way, ma\\'am. EDDIE There was too much press hangin\\' around there. I didn\\'t want her face on the news. So I told him to take her to a quiet area until things settled down. DUFFY Oh. EDDIE It was my decision, not his. DUFFY Well, I\\'m the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I\\'d like to be included in decisions. EDDIE Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours. DUFFY Oh yeah...? Alright. EDDIE (to Jordy) I\\'m ready to be briefed. (to Duffy) Excuse us. DUFFY (to Eddie) Yeah, sure. (to Jordy) Beep me when you\\'re ready for the press conference. JORDY Will do, Chief. Eddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant\\'s desk - toward the back and to his office. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Eddie, I... Eddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy. EDDIE Wait. INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DETECTIVE ROOM\\'S SQUAD - DAY A handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee. Eddie enters with Jordy. EDDIE Guys...give me a few minutes? They empty out. JORDY Look, Eddie, I\\'m tellin\\' you - I didn\\'t touch her. EDDIE Well, you shoulda because nobody\\'s gonna believe you didn\\'t...including me. JORDY I took her there for a shower and that\\'s it. EDDIE Just a shower? Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look. JORDY Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I\\'m sure you probably think I\\'m a fool and I fucked up, but... EDDIE No, I don\\'t think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don\\'t know her well enough. She\\'s got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it\\'s fuckin\\' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You\\'re dead. JORDY I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she\\'s innocent. EDDIE Well, it\\'s not up to you to decide whether she\\'s innocent or not. Don\\'t you understand, that\\'s why you\\'re a professional. JORDY But, I mean, didn\\'t you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin\\' her whole story...I believed her. EDDIE How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here\\'s a number of an Immigration lawyer. That\\'s how you help her. But you can\\'t get involved in her like that. You\\'re gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you\\'re gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don\\'t watch TV but I\\'ll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin\\' world watches television. And when you get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little fuckin\\' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. And I get more done because of it. Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat. JORDY Why\\'d you help me back there with the Chief? Why\\'d you stand up for me like that? EDDIE You know, I don\\'t know. I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him. Eddie picks up his cigar that\\'s going out. He sticks it in his mouth. A match is lit. He looks up. Jordy holds the match. Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs. The homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look. INT. EDDIE\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Eddie walks in - carrying flowers. He closes and locks the door behind him. He grabs the phone. Dials. EDDIE It\\'s Flemming...anything turn up? Did they check the hospitals? Airports? Yeah, I hit him! I fuckin\\' hit him! We should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything! These guys are from fuckin\\' Czechoslovakia... He looks at the flowers. Decides to put the case behind him for a moment. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) I\\'ll call you later. He HANGS up. Arranges the flowers in a vase. So they look perfect. Sets them on the coffee table. Fills out a card, writes, \"Nicky, I love you. Will you marry me?\" He sticks the card in the flowers - turns the lights down low. Puts a romantic Sinatra song on the stereo. Moves to the liquor cabinet. Pours himself a drink. He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the flowers. There\\'s a knock at the door. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Coming! Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door. But the hallway is empty. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Nicky!?!? No answer. Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in his hand. Walks toward the elevator. Doesn\\'t notice the shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment. Eddie turns. No sign of anyone. EDDIE (CONT\\'D) Nicky?! He walks back toward his apartment. Turns and locks the door. A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the head with a gun. Eddie tumbles to the floor! OUT COLD! A BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE as it\\'s focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up. Emil is sitting in front of him. On the coffee table alongside him are the flowers in a vase. They\\'ve ransacked the place. Emil has Eddie\\'s watch, his gold shield and his money. He\\'s smoking one of Eddie\\'s cigars and in Emil\\'s hand...is the diamond engagement ring and card. Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie. He moves to the corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate Eddie\\'s face. EMIL So...who\\'s Nicky? EDDIE What do you want? EMIL Your opinion. (leaning forward) You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books. EDDIE (sarcastic) What\\'s your accomplishment. EMIL I kill someone famous. EDDIE Then do it, asshole. EMIL Good - be tough to the end. Actor who plays you will want to die like hero. Eddie looks at the videocamera. Emil answers Eddie\\'s look. EMIL (CONT\\'D) So tabloids don\\'t have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time. EDDIE If you kill me and film it you\\'re putting a noose around your neck. Emil turns to Oleg. EMIL Turn it off. Oleg obeys. Emil turns to Eddie. EMIL (CONT\\'D) No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their murders? (gestures to Eddie) So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called? (Eddie says nothing) Oh - I got it. Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can\\'t be tried for same crime twice. We come out free, rich and famous! OLEG Good idea! EDDIE You really think you\\'ll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin\\' stupid are you? EMIL Smarter than Americans. You\\'re fed cry baby talk shows all day long. Not only will Americans believe me, they\\'ll cry for me. (laughs) So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now? Eddie says nothing. Just stares at Emil. Emil puffs on Eddie\\'s cigar. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Okay. He has nothing to say. (signaling Oleg) Start the camera! OLEG Cut! Emil looks at Oleg. OLEG (CONT\\'D) This is my project. I say \\'action.\\' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say \\'action!\\' Emil looks at Eddie as if to say, \"See what I have to put up with.\" Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera. OLEG (CONT\\'D) And...action! Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie\\'s service revolver. Eddie suddenly KICKS at Emil\\'s hand, but Emil pulls it away, backing out of Eddie\\'s reach. EMIL Bad last moment - I cut that out. Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie\\'s left temple. Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil\\'s arm. Standing and following his head up Emil\\'s arm and pushing him over into the desk. Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor. Oleg still grips the videocamera. Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall. Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as Emil is limping for it. Eddie knocks Emil out of the way with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him from the wall. Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa. Falling on top of him, rolling over and leaving Oleg on the sofa. Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun. Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is not clear in the darkness who has the gun. Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera. Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp. Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in the stomach. Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE\\'S STOMACH. Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to the chair - holding the gun. Eddie can\\'t believe he got stabbed. Blood swells around his stomach. He can\\'t be dying. This can\\'t be happening. He looks at Emil. The pain is terrible. Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a close up. Emil looks at Eddie. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Die. Die. Emil looks around. Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie off, suffocating him. BLACKNESS We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you feel is the motion. We are travelling very fast. Finally, in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a tiny pixel on a TV screen. WIDENING further out we see Eddie\\'s funeral on the evening news. It\\'s an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and dignitaries. In the upper right hand corner, superimposed over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in his NYPD uniform. We see Oleg\\'s reflection on the set with the videocamera. He is filming the TV. We hear the audio from Eddie\\'s funeral. NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.) ..Detective Flemming was one of the most decorated NYPD detectives in the history of New York. He made several thousand arrests during his career, including the famed Stephen Geller case. Beloved by the community in which he served. His partner eulogized him... Leon is at the mic. LEON (ON T.V.) ...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend and my partner...he taught me the meaning of the word \\'cop.\\' He was a man in every sense of the word. I\\'ll miss him... (choking on tears) Sleep well, brother. Leon begins to sing \"Amazing Grace.\" Oleg PANS from the TV and focuses it on a lightbulb. Hands enter the frame - carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray. A long hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb. Again, the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE. VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this. INT. P.B. HERMAN\\'S RESTAURANT - DAY It\\'s packed with COPS drinking. Prosecutors...lawyers...many who were at the funeral, including Leon. All wear the black ribbon on their badges. There\\'s a quality of an Irish wake - boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform. A buffet has been laid out. Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon. He greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon. HAWKINS Awful...what an awful day. He was New York City. Hawkins notices a young man by the window. Teary-eyed. It\\'s Tommy. Hawkins nods to him. TOMMY I never got to tell him how much I admired him. HAWKINS I know, son, I know. We all loved him. Hawkins moves on...greeting others. He notices at the end of the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette. He moves to her. Pulls up a stool alongside her. She turns, looks at him. Just stares at him for a long beat. She is bombed. Definitely drunk. She\\'s had many. She turns to Hawkins. NICOLETTE You know...you know he was gonna propose to me. The crime guys found a card he\\'d written out to me. And a ring box...these fuckers that killed him - have my ring. They have my diamond engagement ring... Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion. HAWKINS I know. NICOLETTE What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me? HAWKINS Well, he... NICOLETTE (overriding) I want to hear everything he said. HAWKINS I\\'m trying to tell you. NICOLETTE Alright. Go ahead. HAWKINS That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage. NICOLETTE Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him. I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!! Nicolette is crying now. She angrily wipes away a tear. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) I\\'d never had a great relationship before. I\\'d never made great choices with men. And he wasn\\'t easy to get to know. He was older, my parents told me I was nuts to get involved with him. But he was so great to me. Always encouraging, telling me I could do anything... (beat) He was the one. You know, I\\'d give up everything - everything - for just a little more time. I would\\'ve spent fifteen minutes with him if that\\'s all I knew I had. She\\'s lost it. Hawkins consoles her. Nicolette shrugs him off - turns back to her drink. Downs the rest of it. A woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins\\' producer - assistant in tow. MAGGIE Robert...? HAWKINS What are you doing here? MAGGIE (holding a cellular) You\\'ve got a call. HAWKINS I can\\'t talk to anybody right now, can\\'t you see I\\'m busy! I can\\'t talk business. Hang up. Have a drink. (to Paulie) Get her a whiskey. MAGGIE Trust me, you\\'ll want to take this call. Robert steps off the stool. Takes the phone. HAWKINS Hello? Who is this? (listens) How do I know this is you? Hawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder. Backs away from the bar. Now out of hearing distance, he looks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice. HAWKINS (CONT\\'D) Where? We INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie theater. Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws glances into the theater. EMIL Come to 45 Broadway. Don\\'t bring the Police. Come alone or you\\'ll be in my next film. HAWKINS (low) Look asshole. I\\'ve been threatened by better than you. EMIL No. I\\'m the best that\\'s ever threatened you. HAWKINS I\\'ll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me. EMIL We\\'ll talk about that. Four o\\'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars. HAWKINS What? It doesn\\'t work that way. EMIL (incensed) If you don\\'t want my film - I\\'ll call another show. And they will show it. HAWKINS Wait a minute. Wait a minute. EMIL Come alone. Bring cash. And we\\'ll talk about surrendering. CLICK. The line goes dead. Hawkins disconnects. Hands the phone back to Maggie. She\\'s looking at him. Excited. Hawkins looks at Nicolette. His mind whirls. INT. FIRE STATION 91 - KITCHEN - DAY Daphne and Korfin are sitting at a table. Korfin\\'s arm is in a sling, his side bandaged. Duffy and Jordy enter in their dress uniforms. Korfin walks over to them. KORFIN How was it? JORDY (numb) Not good. Jordy\\'s quiet. Dazed. Nobody can believe Eddie\\'s gone. DUFFY (nods to Daphne) Did the D.A. videotape her deposition? KORFIN Yeah. He finished awhile ago. DUFFY (to Korfin) Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that? KORFIN Yeah. Jordy looks at her. Duffy sees them hold each other\\'s look. JORDY Chief - mind if I take her? DUFFY Okay. But not water sports. Duffy walks out. Jordy leads Daphne out of the station. Korfin follows. A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello who points as Jordy walks by. The man chases after Jordy. MAN Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw? JORDY Yeah. MAN (shoving papers in Jordy\\'s hand) Consider yourself served. Jordy opens the papers. Korfin puts Daphne in the car. Walks back over to Jordy and reads over his shoulder. KORFIN Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the department and the city of New York for 10 million? Who is Zwangendaba? Jordy remembers...and gets more depressed. JORDY The mugger. EXT. DAPHNE\\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT It\\'s an old brownstone - in poor condition. Jordy pulls up. Opens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering her to the door. He is edgy. Jumpy. Looking around. DAPHNE Are you alright? JORDY I still can\\'t believe Eddie\\'s gone. DAPHNE I\\'m sorry. He looks at her. Nods. They walk up to the stairs as the front door opens. A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked. Jordy pulls Daphne out of the way. DAPHNE (CONT\\'D) (in Czech to the man) Hello. How are you? INT. DAPHNE\\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Jordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs. A bouquet of flowers are outside Daphne\\'s apartment. JORDY What\\'s this? She takes the card. Jordy looks over her shoulder. Daphne reads: \"Good luck with all your troubles. I\\'m here if you need me...Ludwig.\" JORDY (CONT\\'D) Is he your boyfriend? DAPHNE Ludwig? He\\'s gay - are you jealous? JORDY If I was your boyfriend, I might be. DAPHNE If you were my boyfriend, I\\'d suggest you find another girlfriend that isn\\'t going to jail ten-thousand miles away. They\\'re staring in each other\\'s eyes. The sexual tension strong. JORDY A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one. DAPHNE No matter what happens...I\\'m glad I met you. JORDY I\\'m glad I met you. They hold each other\\'s eyes...then suddenly they kiss. Urgently. Passionately. Somebody is coming up the stairs. They part quickly. A tenant enters his apartment down the hall. Jordy clears his throat. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Let\\'s get your stuff. He opens the door. Peers inside - checking it out. Turns to her. Gestures that it\\'s okay to enter. INT. DAPHNE\\'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS It\\'s very small. Almost no furniture. The bare minimum. The apartment is a hole. She looks at Jordy. Both thinking the same thought. Another kiss. JORDY You better get packed. DAPHNE Right. She holds his look. JORDY Do you have coffee? DAPHNE In the kitchen. JORDY I\\'ll make some for us. DAPHNE I\\'ll get my clothes. She heads down the hall. Jordy enters the small kitchen. He flips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES - SETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO THE ROOM. Jordy JUMPS BACK. DAPHNE (CONT\\'D) Jordy!!! JORDY No! Get back! GET BACK!!! Jordy\\'s more surprised than shaken. It\\'s a fire - he knows the drill. He pushes her into the living room. Then notices a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall. Grabs it. Aims it at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen. He SPRAYS as Daphne SCREAMS! DAPHNE That\\'s not mine! WHOOOOOOOOOSH! The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE! Flames leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher because it\\'s filled with gasoline. The handle LOCKS! Jordy CAN\\'T TURN IT OFF. Flames engulf the extinguisher and JORDY\\'S HAND. He flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. Closes the door. Jordy takes off his jacket. Stuffs it under the bottom of the door. Blocking the smoke. He hurries into the living room. Knowing it\\'s moments before the extinguisher will explode. Jordy pulls out his cellular. Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a chair through the window. JORDY Don\\'t! It\\'ll suck the flames toward us! Too late. She SMASHES the window. There\\'s an EXPLOSION in the kitchen. Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along the ceiling. Jordy yells into the phone: JORDY (CONT\\'D) This is Jordan Warsaw! We got a 1075, make it quick, we\\'re trapped! 8th Avenue and 44th Street. He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom. It\\'s locked. Jordy kicks it open. Grabs the comforter off the bed. Shoves that under the door jam. He pulls Daphne into the bathroom. Shuts the door. Runs his severely burned hand under the cold water. Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens. She notices someone has nailed the window shut. And on top of one nail...is Eddie\\'s gold shield. DAPHNE Oh my G-d! Oh my G-d! Jordy turns - sees Eddie\\'s shield. DAPHNE (CONT\\'D) They were here! This freaks her out. They were in her home. She starts to panic. JORDY Calm down. Get a hold of yourself! Get down! He pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub. In it is a CAN OF GASOLINE. A virtual bomb. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Oh Jesus! Daphne reaches for the can of gasoline. JORDY (CONT\\'D) What are you doing? DAPHNE Pouring it out! She grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain. The FIRE is raging outside the bathroom. The bathroom door is beginning to smoke and burn. They are trapped. Jordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the wall to the ceiling. He throws his feet against the wall for leverage. Pulls with all his might to break it loose. It\\'s creaking - but he\\'s having a hard time with it. DAPHNE (CONT\\'D) Oh shit! Jordy looks over. The gasoline she\\'s pouring out - is not going down the drain. It\\'s stopped up. As soon as the fire gets in the bathroom, everything will explode! Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. Daphne comes over - helps him. Both of them trying to break it off. Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room. SOAKING THE WALLS. They point the pipe toward the door, soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door. Trying to stop the fire from coming in. He and Daphne are drenched. And trapped. Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe. Starts SMASHING the wall behind them. The wall to the adjacent apartment. VIDEO POV Jordy and Daphne in the bathroom - surrounded by fire. CAMERA WHIP PANS down the street as FIRE ENGINES arrive. OLEG is VIDEOTAPING them from the opposite rooftop. Tenants from Daphne\\'s building are fleeing down the fire escape. Emil stands in back of Oleg - who is very excited. He turns the camera on himself. OLEG This is great film! You can see fire right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire Marshal is here. Everything is so messy. Everything is so crazy right here! Look at this fire! We made it! 90% of people who die in fire die from eating smoke. So most likely they all die from eating smoke. The CAMERA PANS to Emil. OLEG (CONT\\'D) And this is the man who started the fire. Say something to your fans, Emil! Emil waits a beat and then blows a kiss to the lens. DAPHNE\\'S BATHROOM Filled with smoke. You can barely see Jordy or Daphne. Jordy SMASHES a hole in the wall - which reveals the bathroom in the apartment next door. The smoke has a place to escape. There\\'s a 7-year old KID in there. Standing in the bathroom. Terrified. JORDY Get back! Get out of the bathroom! Run! 7-YEAR OLD KID The hallway is on fire! JORDY It\\'s okay. I\\'m a fireman. I\\'m going to help you. Get back! Now! Jordy pushes Daphne through the wall - turns as the bathroom door catches fire. It\\'s seconds before the whole room will blow up. OLEG Across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it EXPLODES! EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS Fire engines have arrived. The street is filled with gawkers. Garcia and Korfin pull up just as Jordy runs from the building - holding the kid in one arm and pulling Daphne with the other. Carefully guarding his bandaged hand. A fireman grabs the kid. Another grabs Daphne. Garcia and Korfin run to Jordy. GARCIA Jordy! What the hell happened?! KORFIN Are you alright, man? Lemme see the hand! JORDY Where\\'s Daphne? Daphne? He spots Daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes through the crowd. VOICE Isn\\'t she a beauty? She\\'s my fire, look at that loom-up on her! Jordy turns - it\\'s Max. The attention pyromaniac who Jordy threw out of his office. As a news crew arrives, Max turns to the cameras. MAX I did this! I did this! Take my picture! I\\'m Max! Max Gornick! Jordy grabs Max - pushes him away. JORDY Get outta here! KORFIN What the hell happened? JORDY They were inside. They booby trapped her apartment! Korfin scans the crowd. Looking for Emil and Oleg. In the b.g., Duffy is SCREAMING. DUFFY What the hell are you talking about??? They\\'re gonna do what? Jordy and Korfin turn. The Chief has a phone to his ear and is freaked. INT. LOBBY OF CHANNEL 12 BROADCASTING - NIGHT JORDY\\'S POV as he enters the TV station. His clothes burnt and still wet. The lobby\\'s full of ANGRY COPS. Tommy and Leon, still in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk. TOMMY Where is he?! Where is Hawkins?! MAGGIE He\\'s not on the premises! LEON I want the tape. Go get it and bring it here this minute. MAGGIE Any request for the video must be directed to \"Top Story\\'s\" attorney - Bruce Cutler. I\\'ll be happy to give you his number. Leon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands. Tommy pushes past the security guard to follow Leon. They continue toward Maggie, pushing her further back into the office. She tries to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open. LEON Lady, if you put Eddie\\'s murder on TV, I\\'ll get a warrant for your arrest and shove it so far up your ass it\\'ll come outta your mouth! MAGGIE I want your shield number! HAWKINS (O.S.) Viewer discretion advised! MAGGIE (pointing at the TV) You want the tape? There it is! Leon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set which is mounted in the lobby. The \"Top Story\" logo flashes on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk. HAWKINS What we are about to broadcast is very graphic footage... Everyone is riveted. But Jordy notices outside...a \"Top Story\" NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley. Robert Hawkins jumps from a doorway and into the van. Jordy backs out. INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - NIGHT POP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is popped. The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the table. He nods at the waiter who leaves. Emil raises the glass - looking into the lens. EMIL America! Who says you can\\'t be success in America? I arrived with nothing, knowing nobody - now look - I am a success story! The videocamera is lowered. Oleg turns it off. Asks suspiciously. OLEG You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we? EMIL Oleg, don\\'t be paranoid. You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn\\'t you? I gave you half of what they gave me. Look - here we are! Emil gestures toward the big television set. We are in Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling. Robert Hawkins is introducing his show. HAWKINS (ON T.V.) Good evening. Welcome to \"Top Story\". Tonight, I present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never before seen on television. And I do so with a heavy heart. You will be first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide Detective, Eddie Flemming. It would be only normal to ask, why? Why are we showing something so journalist, I must show it. A democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don\\'t deserve our democracy, or our freedom. Eddie Flemming was my friend. I cried when I watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward. Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you. One final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children. The restaurant BUZZES. Emil checks his watch. OLEG In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me? EMIL The one who got caught in the bathroom. (beat) George Michael. Emil laughs. Oleg doesn\\'t. OLEG I\\'m serious. EMIL Shut up. Look! Emil points towards the TV. \"Top Story\" is continuing. The scene cuts to Emil\\'s video footage. Eddie is handcuffed to the chair. The light illuminating his face. OLEG (O.S.) This is my project. I say \\'action.\\' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say \\'action.\\' (beat) And \\'action!\\' EMIL Bad last moment - I cut it out. Emil looks at Oleg - furious. EMIL (CONT\\'D) I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape! OLEG Be quiet. Watch. Oleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to Eddie\\'s temple. Eddie pushes him over the desk. Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto the floor. Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall. Eddie and Emil both go for the gun. Eddie knocks him out of the way. Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. Leaves him in a ball on the floor. Oleg comes at Eddie and he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa. The blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more light. Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach. Oleg kneels down for a CLOSE-UP. EMIL Die. Die. EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS Hawkins\\' van drives across Times Square. Jordy\\'s car following. We WIDEN OUT... Eddie\\'s murder is being broadcast on the JUMBOTRON in Times Square. People stare up - stunned. INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS The dinner patrons are watching TV. Shocked. Emil glares at Oleg. EMIL Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director? OLEG Because I am the director. Don\\'t you realize, if it wasn\\'t for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now. EMIL Your idea? I thought it was my idea. Oleg tenses. Emil laughs. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Aren\\'t you just the cameraman? Oleg doesn\\'t laugh. OLEG I\\'m serious...this - this is a great American film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit. EMIL Credit? OLEG Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul. EMIL Yes. But there\\'s only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don\\'t share credit. Oleg is pissed. EMIL (CONT\\'D) You got that? OLEG No, I don\\'t get that! EMIL You think you are a director? You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit. And I hate you. I fucking hate you. Emil slaps Oleg across the face. Oleg stands up. Emil suddenly pulls out Eddie\\'s gun but before he can pull the trigger, Oleg STABS Emil in the arm! Emil squeezes off a shot through the crowded restaurant. Patrons SCREAM - Oleg runs through the restaurant, escaping. It\\'s chaos. Hawkins arrives with a crew and with BRUCE CUTLER, a confident, tough criminal attorney. Emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin - pressing it to his wound. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Oh, hello. Cutler accesses the situation. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Are you my attorney? (extends his hand to Cutler) I\\'m Emil. I\\'m insane. CUTLER I\\'m not your lawyer until I see the money. EMIL Here. I have your money. Emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler. Cutler opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins. Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware aside. Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside, freaking. He\\'s lost the most important thing in his life. EMIL (CONT\\'D) Oh no! No! Shit! CUTLER (follows Emil - reaching out to him) Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for? EMIL He has the camera! He took the movie! Jordy comes in, gun raised. JORDY Don\\'t move! Don\\'t move! Get your hands up! Drop it! Emil puts his hands in the air. Immediately drops the gun! EMIL I give up! Jordy is disappointed! He didn\\'t want to take Emil alive. Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil\\'s head. CUTLER This man is unarmed, officer. He\\'s surrendered. Jordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down. CUTLER (CONT\\'D) What are you hitting him for? JORDY Turn that camera off! Jordy handcuffs him. Emil turns to the camera for sympathy, appearing more hurt than he is. EMIL No. Keep filming... Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in that moment why he\\'s surrendering. Jordy yanks Emil up - dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still favoring his ankle. CUTLER (to Emil) Don\\'t say anything. EMIL Where are we going? CUTLER I\\'m coming with you. EMIL Yes. Yes, come with me! CUTLER (to Jordy) I\\'m invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel. I\\'m coming with him. The \"Top Story\" crew is all over them, filming everything. Cutler stays close to Emil. Making sure he\\'s in the video footage. JORDY Turn that camera off! EXT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving. Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door to his car. Leon grabs Emil. LEON I\\'ll take him. JORDY No way! He\\'s mine! LEON (holding on to Emil, squeezing his arm hard) We\\'re takin\\' him. Don\\'t argue! JORDY He\\'s my collar! LEON Well, he killed my partner! JORDY He\\'s yours but I take him in! I\\'ll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I\\'m walkin\\' him in. Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into custody. LEON Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes. I\\'ll follow you. Tommy, you ride with him! Leon stares hatefully into Emil\\'s eyes. LEON (CONT\\'D) You\\'re goin\\' down, motherfucker, you are goin\\' down. I\\'ll be there with a smile when they put you down! Cutler hurries to Emil\\'s side. CUTLER Don\\'t say a word. Don\\'t respond to his taunting! (to Leon) He\\'s represented by counsel. You want to speak to someone - you speak to me! TOMMY Out of the way, counselor. Tommy shoves Cutler aside. CUTLER Don\\'t you put your hands on me, Detective. Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door. Leon turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything. LEON And you, you\\'ll pay for what you did! HAWKINS (low) This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they\\'ll convict him. Leon looks at him. This man used to be his friend. LEON You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself. HAWKINS If I didn\\'t put it on somebody else would! I was his friend! LEON Don\\'t give me that fucking shit. The cameras are rolling. MURPHY Don\\'t get into it on TV. LEON (yells to other cop cars) Alright, let\\'s get going! Leon and the other cops rush to their cars. Jordy is already behind the wheel. As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger seat, Jordy takes off. The cameras film him driving away. INT. JORDY\\'S CAR - NIGHT Jordy takes a left turn, racing away. Running all the lights. TOMMY What are you doin\\'? You\\'re gonna lose everybody! Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side Highway. The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left lane - having lost the police. TOMMY (CONT\\'D) Where are you goin\\'?? This ain\\'t the way to the station! Jordy looks up at Emil in the rear view mirror. EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY EXIT - CONTINUOUS Jordy pulls off on 130th Street. They are way uptown in the middle of nowhere. The car drives down a dark street. Crumbled, vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are no people around. EXT. DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS The car slows down. Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what\\'s going on. Jordy stops at a dead end. Pulls open the back door, yanks Emil out and starts to drag him up into the deserted tunnel. TOMMY Jordy...??? Listen to me. You can\\'t do this. This isn\\'t the way to do things. Jordy ignores Tommy, slamming him up against the tunnel wall. JORDY Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment? EMIL My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it\\'s my friend. JORDY Tommy, take a walk. TOMMY What are you gonna do? JORDY Don\\'t you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That\\'s why he videotaped Eddie\\'s murder - he thinks he\\'s gonna get off. TOMMY Don\\'t stoop to his level! Jordy tosses the car keys to Tommy. JORDY Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy. TOMMY Look, you can\\'t shoot him in cold blood. JORDY (erupting) GET OUTTA HERE NOW!! GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!! DO WHAT I SAY OR I\\'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!! Tommy nervously backs up toward Jordy\\'s car. Climbs behind the wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in the darkness. Jordy takes out Eddie\\'s pistol. The one Emil took from Eddie. Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets left. Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie\\'s gun in Emil\\'s belt. He drags Emil away from the wall, into the center of the empty space - unlocks Emil\\'s handcuffs and throws them aside. Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles around to face him. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Get your hands up! Get your hands up! Now facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the same place he put Emil\\'s. JORDY (CONT\\'D) You wanna be a real American? Go for your gun. Emil holds his arms out - making it clear he\\'s not going for the gun. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Pull the gun! You want to be famous? Shoot me, you\\'ll get more headlines and make more money. Emil watches Jordy...a slow grin spreads across his face. EMIL You can\\'t kill me. You\\'re not a cop. Just fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life. JORDY You\\'ll be my first. Jordy pulls out his 9mm and pushes the barrel right between Emil\\'s eyes. EMIL C\\'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you\\'re sweating. You don\\'t have the balls. JORDY Get down on your knees. Emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in Czech. SIRENS fill the air. Police cars come flying down the street. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Where\\'s your partner? EMIL The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He\\'ll kill you. Leon runs up. Tommy\\'s relieved to see Jordy didn\\'t kill Emil. LEON Gimme your gun, Jordy. We all want him dead but you can\\'t do it this way. Emil is still smiling. Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the face. Knocking him to the floor. He jumps in his car and speeds away. INT. BROADWAY SHERATON - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT A room service WAITER wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of Crystal, with three glasses, toward Oleg\\'s room. Jordy follows behind him - gun aimed at his back. WAITER Do you really need me? JORDY Keep your mouth shut. Don\\'t mess this up. They reach the room. Jordy flattens himself against the wall. The waiter KNOCKS. HOOKER\\'S VOICE Who\\'s there? WAITER (nervous) R-room service. A HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking out at the waiter. HOOKER Come in. Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing the hooker back out of the room. Jordy moves to the bedroom door. Peers through the crack. Oleg sits on the edge of the bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes. He\\'s hooked up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his footage of the fire. OLEG Look at that. See that shot! Seamless. No cuts. (excited) And look. Look at that transition. That\\'s filmmaking!! Isn\\'t it great?! Jordy KICKS in the door - gun raised. JORDY Don\\'t move! Oleg grabs the videocamera. Has on hooker in a head lock and picks up the other one. He rushes at Jordy - using one of the hookers for protection. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Drop the girl! Drop her!! Oleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into the living room and over the back of the sofa. Oleg rushes out into the HOTEL HALLWAY Oleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down the stairwell. EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT Oleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway. He runs through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside! Jordy chases him, gun in hand! Oleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic, cars braking to a stop. One SLAMS into another. Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg. People gawk. Even in New York, it\\'s odd to see a man being chased in his underwear. Oleg runs, knocking people aside. He\\'s holding the camera in his hand. It\\'s on. JORDY STOP! STOP THAT MAN! A UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him. Knocking him down. Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into: INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS Oleg, gun in hand, runs past the TICKET TAKER at the door. TICKET TAKER Hey, come back here! The ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy counter. Jordy rushes in the door. JORDY Where is he? Where\\'d he go? TICKET TAKER Middle door. Jordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle door - and enters the theater through the far door. INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT Jordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle. It\\'s a night scene, the theater is dark. Jordy tries to see faces. He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle. DRUNK\\'S VOICE Kill him! Kill the bastard! Jordy spins toward the voice - it\\'s a DRUNK. Others start YELLING for blood! AUDIENCE Shoot him! SHOOT! A GUNSHOT! Jordy ducks! Another GUNSHOT! Jordy realizes the shots are coming from the screen. OLEG Look! Over here! Jordy turns. Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to film Jordy\\'s death with a videocamera. Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders and heads, bounding for the screen. JORDY Everybody down! Stay DOWN! Jordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away. Some in the audience don\\'t realize the real thing is happening. Oleg leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it. Jordy runs down the aisle. Oleg FIRES at Jordy. Jordy FIRES back. People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can\\'t get a clear shot. Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer. Jordy raises up as the theater lights go on...and Oleg is gone! Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has disappeared. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Shit! SIRENS are heard from outside. VOICES of cops are heard as they enter. CLOSE ON TV A REPORTER is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie theater. REPORTER (ON T.V.) ...and the wild chase through Times Square ended with the suspect, Oleg Razgul, escaping. The fire department has identified the fire marshal involved in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw. The channel is changed. PETER ARNETT is reporting the same story. PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.) In a related matter, Mr. Slovak\\'s attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for handling sensational cases - claims his client is unfit to stand trial. INT. JAIL CELL - WIDER - DAY Daphne sitting on a bench in a jail cell. Watching TV through the bars. She is in the fire department\\'s holding cell in Brooklyn. PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.) In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was not the alleged mastermind behind the murders. According to Cutler, Mr. Slovak was being directed by his partner, who threatened to kill him if he didn\\'t follow Mr. Razgul\\'s orders. Cutler told reporters today that Mr. Razgul did in fact stab his client. The scene CUTS TO Cutler\\'s press conference. CUTLER My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. What\\'s happened is not his fault. Emil was under the influence of his partner. At the trial, you\\'ll see that my client will be vindicated... INT. BELLEVUE - MENTAL OBSERVATION UNIT - DAY The CAMERA WIDENS from the TV set. We are now in an interview room, a guard is posted outside the room. Emil sits at a small table - with Cutler. Emil is dressed in Bellevue clothes. He\\'s handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged. Emil gives a complimentary nod toward Cutler. CUTLER I brought you some letters. It\\'s really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check. EMIL You bring the cigarettes? CUTLER Oh, sure. Cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in Emil\\'s mouth and lights it for him. Emil has never smoked before. CUTLER (CONT\\'D) How\\'re they treating you, alright (Emil is nonresponsive) I want to get the cuffs off... but there\\'s a little bit of a problem. Things out there are very negative right now for us. We gotta change that around. Perception is very, very important. Perception is reality. I know you\\'re not fuckin\\' crazy. But it\\'s important that I get that message out. Cause that\\'s our only defense in this case. Emil leans forward. Cutler retrieves the cigarette from between his lips. CUTLER (CONT\\'D) I want you to focus on three things: fear... He puts the cigarette back in Emil\\'s mouth. CUTLER (CONT\\'D) ...delusions and paranoia. EMIL I was all of these. CUTLER Well, you didn\\'t appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that. EMIL What about Oleg? CUTLER Disappeared. They\\'re looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia. EMIL No, he is here. Shit... CUTLER Don\\'t worry about him. Think about yourself. EMIL What about my movie rights? Book rights? CUTLER Look, I haven\\'t really focused on that kind of thing. EMIL What\\'s your cut? How much? CUTLER I would say...half. Half is fair. EMIL (laughs) No. No way. CUTLER But it\\'s... EMIL Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call another lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don\\'t try to negotiate. Thirty percent. Say yes or no. CUTLER This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me. EMIL What else do you need? CUTLER I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you\\'re here. EMIL (indicating cigarette) Give me another one, please. Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil\\'s mouth. Lights it. CUTLER Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like. EMIL My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind. CUTLER Your mother was blind? EMIL Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me. CUTLER Back in the Czech Republic? EMIL Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness... CUTLER Your father blamed you for your mother\\'s blindness? EMIL Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out? Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil\\'s lips and extinguishes it. EMIL (CONT\\'D) That\\'s what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me. CUTLER Your father put cigarettes out on you? EMIL Out on my back when I was a small boy. CUTLER Can I see your back? Emil rises. Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up. HIS ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM CIGARETTE BURNS. Cutler recoils - horrified. CUTLER (CONT\\'D) Oh, Jesus. EMIL I\\'m abused. Don\\'t you think? CUTLER I don\\'t think it\\'s abuse, I think it\\'s torture. INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DUFFY\\'S OFFICE - DAY Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk. Jordy stands across the table from his Chief. Behind Jordy we can see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening. Duffy has a subpoena in his hand. DUFFY The public doesn\\'t have any idea what we do and now you\\'re going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King! JORDY What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot. DUFFY Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?! JORDY Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian. DUFFY Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine. JORDY End my career? DUFFY How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn\\'t gotten away and you\\'d been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. You\\'d have the good to weight against the bad! It\\'s unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there\\'s nothing I can do! Gimme your shield. JORDY But Chief? Over this?? DUFFY There\\'s nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You\\'re suspended until your trial. Jordy sighs. Dying inside. He surrenders his shield. Drops his handcuffs, his pager and his gun. Duffy picks up the gun - looks at it. DUFFY (CONT\\'D) (pats Jordy\\'s shoulder) I know you got backup at home. Drop it off. Jordy sighs and exits. INT. IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent. In another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEYS. STERN (to Jordy) Look, what don\\'t you understand? We\\'ve got a good relationship with the Czech\\'s and the State Department doesn\\'t want to cause an incident. JORDY But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness! STERN They\\'ve got her testimony on videotape. And even if they do take her to court immediately after she\\'ll be extradited. The Czechs want her back. She shot a cop! I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech Republic? How would you feel if the Czechs wouldn\\'t give them back to us?! Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office. Lowers his voice. STERN (CONT\\'D) And just between us...I was married to a redhead. They\\'re a jinx. Redheads are like cross-eyed priests. Stay away from both. Jordy gives him a look. STERN (CONT\\'D) You want to see her - go ahead. Jordy enters the other office. Sits next to Daphne. The assistant U.S. Attorneys leave. JORDY We\\'re gonna fight the extradition. Daphne takes Jordy\\'s bandaged hand in hers. DAPHNE Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own. JORDY ...Do you really want me to forget about you? DAPHNE I don\\'t want to drag you down with me. JORDY Daphne, I... Daphne touches her finger to his lips. DAPHNE Shhhh. She leans in and kisses him. Then looks into his eyes, trying to find a smile. EXT. FEDERAL COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY It\\'s weeks later. Nicolette is looking worn, tired, frazzled. She\\'s trying to go through her stand up. But she\\'s unraveling. Not recovered from the loss of Eddie. NICOLETTE ...and today with his partner who he blamed for the crimes still at large, Emil Slovak will appear in court. His lawyer will argue that he is mentally unfit to stand trial. Eyewitness News has also learned that later this month, Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing in court. He will be arraigned on charges of violating the civil rights of...Zwangen...Zwagen... MIKE Zwangendaba. NICOLETTE Goddamn assholes everywhere. Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba. I got it. I\\'ll do it. Shit. Let\\'s start again. 5-4-3-2-1... She starts over. INT. JORDY\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Jordy\\'s on the couch. A drink in his hand, watching TV with his dog, ZACK. Jordy\\'s eyes are glazed. He\\'s drunk, his eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie\\'s were...without his job or Daphne. His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort. As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger seeps through her broadcast. NICOLETTE (ON T.V.) Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct descendent of the African King from whom he takes his name... Jordy\\'s face is flashed on screen. The phone RINGS. Jordy picks up. JORDY Hello? (listens) No comment. He hangs up. The phone RINGS AGAIN. JORDY (CONT\\'D) Hello? (listens) No! Jordy hangs up. Changes the channel. He stops as Robert Hawkins\\' face fills the screen. He is standing across from someone - in a park - interviewing him. HAWKINS (ON T.V.) He robbed you? The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a suit and tie. Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut. He stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the tree. He\\'s appearing on \"Top Story\". ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.) That\\'s right, I encountered him right here. I was just askin\\' for change an\\' he whips out his big gun an\\' pushes me up against that tree, whereupon he takes my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin\\' me there all exposed... The phone RINGS again. Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off the table and throws it through the window: BACK TO TV as the channel is changed. A REPORTER is on TV. Behind him is a picture of Emil. Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie. The reporter stands in front of the jail. REPORTER ...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak won\\'t have to worry about how he is going to pay for his defense. He has received movie offers and been in conversations with numerous publishers concerning the rights to his life story. REVERSE ANGLE Oleg is at a bar watching TV. Poisoned with envy. INT. JORDY\\'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser. We see the TV overturned in the b.g. His back up gun is on it. He stares at it. Dark thoughts dancing in his head. EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses. Looking inside the park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to Rykers Island. Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster and sticks it in his pocket. CLOSE ON METER to $42.00. The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror. TAXI DRIVER I can\\'t believe this guy got off. Unbelievable. Jordy takes out money. All he\\'s got is fifty bucks and he crams it into the slot. JORDY Whatever\\'s leftover, keep. Jordy exits the cab. The anger rising inside his body is coming to a boiling point. He walks into the park. Leon is sitting on a bench. Just sitting there. Also filled with rage and frustration. Jordy meets his eyes. Leon gets up and walks away. Disgusted by it all. Jordy\\'s right hand grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on. HIGH WIDE SHOT Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. All are waiting for Emil. WE SEE: HAWKINS and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and frazzled, waits Nicolette. Still grieving her loss, she looks over at Hawkins and his crew. She shoots him a disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off. He checks his watch - anxious - looks at his cameraman. HAWKINS He said he\\'d be here. Pick him up as he comes through the crowd. Do you hear me? For Chrissakes don\\'t miss this. THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP Cutler\\'s car behind it. Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from the van. Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the POLICE ESCORTS. The swarm follows - firing questions at Cutler. He answers the barrage of questions with: CUTLER ...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill! Jordy walks alongside the moving mass. His eyes focused on Emil - his hand in his pocket. We notice in the crowd Max, the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac. What\\'s he doing here? Max\\'s hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket. A weird gleam in his eye. We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other cops. Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass. She watches Emil with quiet rage. Cutler continues: CUTLER (CONT\\'D) ...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future. They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who\\'s checking his watch obsessively. HAWKINS Where the hell is he? Goddamn it?! Jordy glares at Emil. Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. Smiles. He won. He beat the system. Jordy suddenly erupts. JORDY You think this is funny?? What the hell are you laughing at? Emil stares down Jordy. Jordy grips the gun inside the jacket. CUTLER (to a nearby escort) Officer, keep this man back, he\\'s assaulted my client on previous occasions. A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil. JORDY This is it? This bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing? CUTLER You may not like it marshal, but that\\'s the law. JORDY And what about the other victims?? What about their families? He\\'ll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing? We let this scumbag walk? Jordy moves past the officer. Emil breaks away from Cutler. Gets in Jordy\\'s face. Laughs quietly. EMIL Be careful. I can kill you. I\\'m insane. Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler. A scuffle breaks out as the cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to: A VIDEO POV as it approaches Hawkins from behind. A hand dips into frame tapping Hawkins on the shoulder. Hawkins turns - sees who he\\'s been waiting for. His face lights up. HAWKINS I thought you wouldn\\'t show up. Where is it? Where is the tape? IT\\'S OLEG In disguise - sunglasses and a hat. Holding his videocamera. OLEG It\\'s all in here. All in here. MEANWHILE JORDY has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins\\' voice cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly: HAWKINS Wait a minute, Bruce! We\\'ve got some interesting evidence, something you should look at! Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks. His crew is taping as he continues introducing his broadcast: HAWKINS (CONT\\'D) I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul, proving Emil Slovak was not insane! Hard to believe...watch! Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his videocamera up in the air. OLEG (ON VIDEO) He knew exactly what he was doing - all of this was planned! It\\'s all here in my movie. Emil is not insane. Look. Look! Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie: EMIL (ON VIDEO) ...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital... CUTLER (points to Oleg) Officers, there\\'s your killer, do your duty, arrest him! The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of reporters separate them. We hear the staccato calls from the press corps. Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage. Jordy notices and starts moving towards her. Before the POLICE CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil. He yells at Oleg! EMIL Traitor!! OLEG No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action! Oleg pulls his gun. Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as: BANG! Oleg FIRES! Cutler is SHOT and goes down. Hawkins swings his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER escorting Emil. Emil grabs the down officer\\'s gun. He swivels - rapid fires at Oleg. Oleg topples. People are screaming. It\\'s CHAOS. Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him. He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at her head. CAPTAIN Drop the gun! DON\\'T SHOOT! EMIL I\\'ll kill her! Back off! Everyone back away from me! We hear Jordy\\'s voice above Emil. JORDY Let her go. Let her fucking go!! The captain is screaming at all his men. CAPTAIN No one shoot! Lower your weapons! Do not fire! No officer will fire his weapon unless I say so! (to Emil) Let the woman go! Cops reluctantly lower their weapons. But Jordy is still aiming his gun at Emil. He is the only one who hasn\\'t lowered his gun. The captain is yelling at him. CAPTAIN (CONT\\'D) Holster your weapons! Back away. That is an order! No officers will fire! Emil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at Emil. EMIL Tell him to put his gun down! JORDY Let her go! Let her go!! EMIL If he doesn\\'t lower his gun I\\'ll fucking kill her. Jordy doesn\\'t lower his gun. Emil tries to back away. The reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping their lenses pointed at the scene. This is great film! Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised. JORDY Let her go. NICOLETTE Shoot! Shoot him!! EMIL Shut up! Meanwhile, the captain is still yelling: CAPTAIN No on shoot! No one shoot!! No officer will follow. No officer will shoot! Nicolette is still encouraging Jordy. NICOLETTE Shoot! Shoot! Shoot him!! EMIL Shut up! Everyone is screaming at once. It\\'s mass chaos. The captain is trying to keep everyone calm. Cops following along with their weapons lowered. All except Jordy - his gun still pointed at Emil. Hawkins can\\'t believe what footage he\\'s getting. He\\'s pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack. Trying to get the best coverage. EMIL (CONT\\'D) I\\'ll surrender!! I\\'ll surrender if he lowers his gun. He\\'s pointing at Jordy but he\\'s continuing to back away towards the police boat. NICOLETTE Don\\'t. Don\\'t let him surrender. Shoot him! Jordy won\\'t take his gun off him. JORDY Let her go. Let her go. The captain is yelling at Jordy. CAPTAIN Lower your weapon. I told you - lower your weapon! Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil. He can\\'t. His heart pounding. Adrenaline pumping. He suddenly lowers his weapon. Turns away. The captain visibly relaxes. Emil laughs. Jordy suddenly turns back. Quickly raises his weapon. JORDY SHOOTS Emil takes a shot in the leg. Nicolette ducks under the handcuffs and scurries away. Emil looks at Jordy - surprised he shot him. Jordy FIRES AGAIN. Emil is hit in the shoulder. Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil\\'s chest. Abdomen. Head. Gun fire echoes in the humid air as Emil stumbles back. Does a funny dance and drops to the ground. Dead. The captain yells. CAPTAIN (CONT\\'D) I told you not to shoot! No officers should shoot. Jordy quietly answers: JORDY I\\'m not a cop. I\\'m a fire marshal. HAWKINS He\\'s still alive. Hawkins looks down at Oleg. He is sprawled on the ground. His videocamera in hand - he\\'s still making the movie. OLEG\\'S VIDEO POV as it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg. He looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps: OLEG A film...by Oleg Razgul. And Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN. Hawkins jumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain. OLEG (CONT\\'D) How was that? Oleg\\'s head rolls to one side. Now dead. Nicolette runs over to Jordy. Composing herself. Coming together. Glad Emil is dead. Jordy starts to walk away. NICOLETTE Wait a minute. Where are you going? Learn from Eddie. Talk to the court of public opinion. Take the credit, you need it. She turns him around. Straightens his tie. Starts to push the hair out of his face but he stops her hand. JORDY No thanks. Jordy puts something in her hand. She looks down. It\\'s EDDIE\\'S BADGE. The one Jordy took out of Daphne\\'s bathroom. She looks up at him. Her cameraman rolling. The lens pointed at Jordy. Jordy looks at Nicolette. Meets her eyes. He doesn\\'t want to make a statement. He still doesn\\'t want the fame. He did learn from Eddie. Eddie was killed because he was a celebrity. Jordy wants no part of it. NICOLETTE Cut. Her cameraman lowers his leans. Jordy smiles. She nods. Jordy turns and walks away. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) Get a shot of him leaving. Then pan to me. Jordy disappears into the sea of people. The camera PANS back to Nicolette. NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) Well, he wouldn\\'t talk to us, but you saw it. The CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette\\'s face and the video is now on: THE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE We PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER. Nicolette finishing her stand up: NICOLETTE (CONT\\'D) New York City has a new hero, Fire Marshal Jordan Warsaw. I hope that Fire Marshal Warsaw\\'s heroic actions this afternoon will help with his other legal problems. WB11 has also learned that the fire Marshal has retained an immigration lawyer to help Daphne Handlova with her case. We wish her well. This is Nicolette Karas, live at Battery Park, WB11 New York. Good night. THE SCREEN FADES TO BLACK.',\n",
       "       \"2012 Written by Roland Emmerich & Harald Kloser Second Draft February 19th, 2008 OVER BLACK We listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the Clarinet Concerto in A. FADE UP EXT. THE SOLAR SYSTEM Space, infinite and empty. But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move into frame and align. The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun. Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles into the blackness of space. FADE TO BLACK 2009 FADE UP EXT. COUNTRY SIDE/INDIA - SUNSET Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66, listens to the music. An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy ship across a puddle. The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy. PROF. WEST Watch out! But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship. In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance. The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics - University of New Delhi'. 2. INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32. PROF. WEST How deep are we? SATNAM 8200 feet. Used to be an old copper mine, Professor, sir. As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting for this science lab. PROF. WEST Helmsley told me that the neutrino count doubled during the last sun eruptions. SATNAM Correct, sir. But that is not what worries me... They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier. SATNAM (CONT'D) There was a new solar storm, so strong that the physical reaction got even more severe. PROF. WEST How can that be? SATNAM We don't know, Professor, sir. Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch on the floor and hot steam rises. SATNAM (CONT'D) The neutrinos suddenly act like... microwaves. Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale. CUT TO: 3. EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and the Capitol Building. ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL AIDES. He is the only African-American among them. One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief of Staff, working the crowd. POLITICAL AID #1 Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he was President. Did you hear, he wants us to sign in and out like school boys? ADRIAN I still can't believe that Wilson chose him of all people to run the White House. POLITICAL AID #2 Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and the Congress. ADRIAN Shame he's such a pompous ass. ANHEUSER (O.S.) Somebody mention my name? Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling. ADRIAN (SHOCKED) Yes sir... No, sir. ANHEUSER Which one is it? ADRIAN We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir. ANHEUSER It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that. Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile. POLITICAL AID #2 That guy scares the shit out of me. At that moment Adrian's cell phone rings. (CONTINUED) 4. ADRIAN (into the phone) Professor West? PROF. WEST (O.S.) I've been trying to reach you! INT. LIVING ROOM/SATNAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT Prof. West is on the phone. In the background we make out Satnam's family around the dining room table. PROF. WEST Listen, Adrian. The situation is much worse than we thought... Satnam quiets his little son. It is the boy we saw earlier with his toy ship. INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY Adrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White House, papers in hand. ADRIAN Sir, the President needs to know this. ANHEUSER Helmsley, how long have you been on the job as science advisor? ADRIAN Four months this week. ANHEUSER I would say that's enough time to learn that we have rules here. You'll just have to wait until the quarterly science briefing. ADRIAN If this is about what I said last night, I am truly sorry, sir. ANHEUSER So you didn't like my speech? Exasperated, Adrian holds out the papers to him. ADRIAN Can you please have a look at this, sir? It's really important. (CONTINUED) 5. Finally, Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts to walk away, reading. Suddenly he slows down. ANHEUSER Who wrote this? ADRIAN An Indian astrophysicist I graduated with from Harvard and Prof. West, the preeminent geologist in the US. ANHEUSER Who else knows about it? ADRIAN No one, sir. ANHEUSER Let's keep it that way, Helmsley. Anheuser walks away. FADE TO BLACK 2010 FADE UP EXT. SEVILLE/SPAIN - DAY G8 Summit. Riot police control the unruly crowd with water cannons. We see PROTESTERS with Anti Globalization signs behind a fence. A convoy of limousines is approaching a historic building. INT. BIG HALL/ALHAMBRA - DAY We follow the American delegation into the conference room, where the other G8 delegations are seated around an enormous table. The President of the United States, THOMAS F. WILSON, 56, doesn't sit down. He addresses the room and everybody goes quiet. PRESIDENT WILSON (O.S.) Good Morning... For the first time we see the President's face. He is African- American. (CONTINUED) 6. PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) I hereby present a motion to meet privately with my seven fellow Heads of State, kindly excluding the rest of the delegates. A murmur erupts. The Russian President SERGEY MAKARENKO, 62, whispers to one of his interpreters. RUSSIAN INTERPRETER Mr. Makarenko wishes to have his interpreters present. President Wilson looks over to the Russian Colleague. PRESIDENT WILSON Mr. President, judging from the conversations we've had in the past, I can assure you, your English is absolutely fine, for what I have to say. As the Russian President waves his interpreter away, all the international delegates leave as well. The huge doors of the hall close. A secret service officer in the sound booth switches off the recording equipment to the chamber. The President gathers himself. PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Six months ago I was made aware of a situation so devastating, that at first, I refused to believe it. (PAUSE) However through the concerted efforts of the brightest scientists of several nations, we have now confirmed its validity. Dead silence. PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) The world as we know it, will soon come to an end. CUT TO: EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN A huge Chinese military helicopter blasts through a majestic mountain valley in Tibet. We are at the top of the world. (CONTINUED) 7. A Chinese COLONEL, wearing dark sun glasses, watches from the chopper as the army forces the evacuation of the villages and monasteries. VOICE (O.S.) (in Chinese) You will have new houses, electricity and running water... EXT. VILLAGE/TIBET - DAY Someone speaks on a megaphone in the village square as villagers are evicted by soldiers and herded into trucks. VOICE (O.S.) ... Some among you will even have the chance to work for the glorious People's Republic of China building the biggest dam project in the world... NENG PANG, a young monk, 18, is loaded into a truck together with his PARENTS, both in their 60's. EXT. SCHOOL/TIBET - DAY Neng's older brother, LIN PANG, 25, is part of a huge crowd of young men and women staying behind by a Tibetan school building. He turns and yells after the truck. LIN I will send you money mother. The Colonel with the dark glasses steps up, addressing the masses. COLONEL Who can read and write? Eager hands fly up in the air. An official makes notes. COLONEL (CONT'D) Who can weld? Lin's hand shoots up in the air. We hear a siren echoing through the mountains and suddenly an explosion. Lin turns. In the BACKGROUND, a series of explosions punch enormous holes into the side of the mountain, showering rock everywhere. FADE TO BLACK (CONTINUED) 8. 2011 FADE UP INT. DORCHESTER HOTEL/LONDON - DAY A MAN in a dark suit walks through a hallway of the Dorchester looking like your typical MI-6 agent. The decor is plush and luxurious. He's stopped by two security men who frisk him. INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/DORCHESTER HOTEL - DAY Heavily ringed fingers flip through a folder. MI-6 OFFICER (O.S.) Has his Highness had the opportunity to study the dossier? A SAUDI PRINCE looks up and nods without expression. SAUDI PRINCE You must understand I have a very big family. Mister... MI-6 OFFICER Isaacs. SAUDI PRINCE Mister Isaacs, one billion dollars is a lot of money. MI-6 OFFICER I'm afraid the amount is in Euros, your Highness. CUT TO: INT. LOUVRE/PARIS - NIGHT A group of dark figures in overalls walk past famous Renaissance paintings. They stop at the Mona Lisa. MANFRED PICARD, 63, head of the French National Museums, stands by LAURA, a young African-American woman in her late 20's. They observe the specialists opening the case of the famous painting. A whoosh of air as the vacuum seal breaks. MANFRED PICARD Laura, I'm putting a lot of trust in your people. (CONTINUED) 9. Laura answers in almost perfect French. LAURA There are too many crazy people who could hurt her, Manfred. The World Heritage Foundation has done this all over the world. In the BACKGROUND the Mona Lisa is taken off the wall and replaced with a perfect replica. Picard still looks uneasy. He watches as the real Mona Lisa is sealed into an airtight case. MANFRED PICARD And she'll be safe now? Tucked away in the Swiss Alps? LAURA Perfectly safe. Picard looks suspicious but says nothing. The CAMERA MOVES IN on the face of the fake Mona Lisa until all we see is her mysterious smile. FADE TO BLACK 2012 FADE UP FUZZY TV IMAGES: Lifeless bodies encircle a huge fire pit. They resemble the rays of the sun. In the background we see the famous step pyramids of Tikal. NEWSCASTER (O.S.) ... The mass suicide was discovered by a BBC documentary crew in the ancient Mayan city of Tikal... Many of the dead are women and children looking peaceful and are surrounded by colorful flowers. NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) ... the victims were said to have adhered to the Mayan-Quiche Calender which predicts the end of time to occur on the 21st of December this year, due to the sun's destructive forces... The CAMERA slowly pulls out and we are in-- 10. INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING A shabby apartment in Silverlake. The TV is on. NEWSCASTER (O.S.) ... Strangely enough, scientific records do support the fact that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history... A small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face of JACKSON CURTIS, 33, pops up from behind the couch. He fell asleep at his laptop last night. JACKSON Oh no. Not again. One look at his watch and he is off running. He throws some clothes and a toothbrush in a bag. His cell phone rings. JACKSON (CONT'D) Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not late. It's not even 10:30... Jackson turns off the TV and darts towards the door, stopping only to slide his laptop into a knapsack. As he turns, he stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink-wrapped and identically titled: `Farewell Atlantis'. JACKSON (CONT'D) Damn it! (into the phone) Kate, I'm on my way... For god's sake... Frustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits. We hold on the books and realize that Jackson's photograph is on their back covers. EXT. JACKSON'S GARAGE/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING The phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door, struggling to pack his old SUV with camping equipment. JACKSON They're kids, Kate, going on vacation. It's not a doctor's appointment... it's supposed to be fun. You remember that, right? Fun? He tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead. Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel. 11. EXT. JACKSON'S STREET/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING Jackson runs across the street with his camping equipment, throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the curb. JACKSON ... I know it's mosquito season at Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on the way. He notices a deep crack in the asphalt. His neighbors, an elderly couple, stand there and stare at it. NEIGHBOR Merrill, we should move back to Wisconsin. Jackson gets into the limo and speeds off. INT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING Jackson drives through LA with the radio on. RADIO HOST (O.S.) ... Those shake-proof coffee mugs are a genius idea, and they just show the true nature of us Californians. We pass a family frantically loading boxes into a van. RADIO HOST (O.S.) (CONT'D) We'll not bow to little inconveniences like these so called `mini-quakes'... Jackson passes a man in a wheelchair. He's holding up a cardboard sign: `Repent - The End is Near'. EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING Jackson stops and honks in front of an upscale Westwood home. RADIO HOST (O.S.) ... If you have a funny `mini-quake' story you wanna share, call Lisa & Randy at 1-800... Jackson switches the radio off. Two kids NOAH, 10, and LILLY, 7, come running down the driveway. They slow down, as they see the limo. NOAH Jackson, what is this? (CONTINUED) 12. JACKSON Don't call me Jackson, Noah, I'm your father. Lilly yells from inside the limo. LILLY (O.S.) Noah! Look! Daddy's got Space-Busters in the car... and Space-Busters 2. Awesome! Their mother, KATE CURTIS, 32, a beautiful woman appears. KATE So what, you're a chauffeur now? What happened to the temp work? JACKSON This is better hours for me. Means I can still write. KATE Of course. Kate's new boyfriend, GORDON SILBERMAN, 43, pulls out of the garage in his Porsche wearing his Bluetooth. GORDON (on the phone) Simone, how many times have I told you, we don't do Lipo on Fridays. It's too messy. Jackson smiles bitterly. Gordon waves at the kids. GORDON (CONT'D) Have fun guys. And watch out for those bears. (to Jackson) Nice car. Jackson waves grudgingly as Gordon pulls away. KATE Noah needs to read twenty pages from his book each day... She follows Jackson to the car with a bag of pull-up diapers. KATE (CONT'D) ... and Lilly has to put these on, before she goes to sleep. JACKSON Still? (CONTINUED) 13. He shuts the trunk and gets back behind the wheel. She looks at him seriously. KATE Jackson, they've been really looking forward to this you know. Don't let them down. He nods as the car pulls away. CUT TO: EXT. SHIP DECK/SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR - DAY HARRY HELMSLEY, 73, and his partner TONY DELGADO, 68, board an enormous cruise ship, the `Freedom of the Seas'. Harry is African-American, Tony is Italian. He carries a large case. They pass a poster: `Jazz Night with Harry Helmsley & Tony Delgado'. HARRY So this time we'll hit the Japs. TONY So what? HARRY Well Tony, electronics are cheap there and... you could visit your boy Will. TONY Afternoon ladies... TONY shoots a charmers smile at a couple of older single ladies on sun loungers. They smile back coyly. HARRY Are you even listening to me? TONY Yes unfortunately I am Harry. HARRY I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa now. TONY Why don't you keep your nose out of my family. You're cramping my style. HARRY He married a Japanese girl - how is that the end of the world? You should at least go see him. (CONTINUED) 14. TONY Why? Do you see your boy? HARRY Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long way. But at least we talk. TONY What about? HARRY Life, how short it is... Suddenly they're thrown off balance by a large swell that pulls the massive `Freedom of the Seas' away from the landing, about ten yards. The next moment, the ship slams back against the dock with an earthshaking BOOM. TONY What the hell was that? A murmur goes through the crowd. Luckily nobody is injured. CUT TO: INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM/D.C. - EARLY MORNING The phone rings twice before Laura switches on a light. We catch a glimpse of a framed photo of her and Adrian. She answers the phone. MANFRED PICARD (O.S.) Laura? They lied to us. LAURA Manfred is that you? EXT. STREETS/PARIS - NIGHT Picard is speeding in his Peugeot, anxiously checking his rear view mirror. MANFRED PICARD I had my suspicions. I should have said something. They are following me. LAURA (O.S.) Who is? MANFRED PICARD They may be listening to us too. Laura the Heritage Foundation is a sham. (CONTINUED) 15. Picard's car approaches a tunnel. LAURA (O.S.) What? MANFRED The art you collected, it's not in the Alps. The Peugeot enters a tunnel. LAURA (O.S.) Then where is it? A huge blast rips through the tunnel as his car explodes. SMASH CUT TO: EXT. ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY JACKSON AND LILLY (singing along to the RADIO) `We all live in a Yellow Submarine...' They're driving through the glorious landscape of Yellowstone National Park. Noah sits in the back with headphones on playing Space-Busters 2. As they pass over a ridge, the music station is overpowered by a talk show filtering through. We hear a raspy and excitable voice. RADIO HOST ... After what is going on in La-La- land with all those surface cracks, I told myself: Get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. I don't want to miss all the great fun, when it finally blows... Lilly reaches for the dial of the radio. LILLY What happened to the music? JACKSON Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to this for a moment... Jackson corrects the dial to get better reception. RADIO HOST ... There's been government people flying in and out all morning. And trust me, they did not look happy... (CONTINUED) 16. A huge black helicopter brushes over the limo. RADIO HOST (CONT'D) ... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie. They watch in awe as the chopper disappears behind a ridge. CUT TO: INT. OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING Laura bursts in and heads straight for the TV. The President looks up from his desk. LAURA You have to see this. Sally the President's Secretary enters, flustered. PRESIDENT WILSON It's alright Sally. Sally closes the door as Laura turns up the TV. CNN ANCHOR ... Mr. Picard had been the director of the French National Museums for 24 years. As fate would have it his assassination took place in the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died in 1997. The President comes around his desk. Laura looks at him distraught. LAURA I just talked to him, Dad. He told me the world Heritage Foundation is a sham. Is that true? The President shoots an anxious look across the room. Laura turns and suddenly realizes that Adrian is standing in the corner. LAURA (CONT'D) You knew too? You sleep with me and you didn't say anything? Adrian looks ashamed. LAURA (CONT'D) I can't even look at you. Either of you! (CONTINUED) 17. PRESIDENT WILSON Honey, calm down. LAURA A man was killed! I want the truth Dad. Right now. CUT TO: EXT. FOREST TRAIL/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY A dense forest trail. We hear Lilly before we see her. LILLY (O.S.) Daddy, where are we going? JACKSON To a very special place, Lil'bee. It's a lake. A place where mommy and daddy fell in love. (winking to Noah) Remember the book I gave you? NOAH I don't want to know where you and mom had sex. I'm not ready for that, Jackson. JACKSON I'm your dad, Noah. LILLY (O.S.) Daddy! Jackson runs to catch up with Lilly who has reached a fence with a `keep out' sign posted. JACKSON This wasn't here before. Jackson starts to climb the fence. NOAH Don't you see the signs? JACKSON It's fine guys. EXT. RIDGE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Jackson and his kids crest a ridge. They look down on a parched basin with cracked terrain. (CONTINUED) 18. JACKSON It's gone. The whole darn lake is gone. I swear you guys there was a lake here. The kids roll their eyes. EXT. EMPTY LAKE BED/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY A puddle of water is all that remains of the lake. Jackson and the kids walk into the basin, unaware of being watched THROUGH BINOCULARS. Jackson spots an electronic measuring device and crouches to have a closer look. Elsewhere in the lake bed, we see sand seeping through CRACKS in the ground. NOAH (O.S.) Jackson! When he looks up, he sees heavily armed soldiers coming towards them from all sides. JACKSON It's okay, Noh'. Through the BINOCULARS, we see Jackson and his kids arrested and led over a ridge. With this we reveal an ENORMOUS RESEARCH FACILITY with hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling tower. EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Adrian Helmsley and Prof. West exit the drilling tower, both studying papers. Adrian notices Jackson and his kids nearby, being interrogated by an OFFICER. ADRIAN I'll be with you in a second, Professor. Adrian walks towards them. Jackson stares at the officer with defiance. OFFICER ... And then you climbed over a posted fence? Just like that? NOAH I told you. (CONTINUED) 19. JACKSON Isn't this supposed to be a National Park? There shouldn't be fences. What are you guys doing around here anyway? ADRIAN (O.S.) We're geologists... Jackson turns and sees Adrian standing there. ADRIAN (CONT'D) I'll handle this officer. Thank you. The officer reluctantly hands him Jackson's license. JACKSON So, where did the lake go? ADRIAN That's what we're trying to find out. We think this whole area has become potentially unstable. I would advise you to take your kids and leave, Mr... He throws a look at Jackson's drivers license. ADRIAN (CONT'D) ... Curtis. He looks up at Jackson with renewed interest. ADRIAN (CONT'D) Are you by any chance the Jackson Curtis, the author of `Farewell Atlantis'? JACKSON (SURPRISED) Yeah, that's me. Jackson straightens up proudly. Lilly smiles. ADRIAN What a coincidence. I'm reading your book, as we speak... first third, around day 300, when the shuttle loses communication with earth and drifts off into space. JACKSON You're one of lucky 422 who bought it. ADRIAN Actually I didn't buy it. My father gave it to me. (CONTINUED) 20. JACKSON Oh, I see. Prof. West waves at Adrian from one of the container labs. Adrian hands back Jackson his drivers license. ADRIAN Officer, can you return them to the campgrounds, please. (to Jackson) Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis. Jackson and his kids look after Adrian hurrying away. LILLY He was very nice. JACKSON Yes he was, Lil'bee. EXT. FOREST TRAIL/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATER Jackson and the kids walk back to the campgrounds when suddenly CHARLIE FROST, 62, a crazy looking guy with binoculars around his neck, stands in their way. CHARLIE FROST What did the government guys tell you? Jackson looks at him, instinctively picking up Lilly. JACKSON They think it's not such a good idea to climb over their fences. They feel the area is unstable. Charlie bursts out laughing. CHARLIE FROST Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable! That's funny... With this he turns around and leaves. EXT. TENT/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK Jackson is sitting on a camp chair, right outside the tent. He's on his laptop, looking enquiringly at an aerial picture of Yellowstone on Google earth. In the background we see the kids are in the tent. (CONTINUED) 21. NOAH There are mosquitos in here. Did anybody spray the tent? Jackson looks up, remembering he forgot the spray. JACKSON We'll get some of that tomorrow. For tonight just put your head under the blankie. LILLY Daddy you said you weren't gonna work on your book. JACKSON I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you wearing your pull-ups? Lilly nods as Jackson walks over and tucks her into bed. He kisses her good night. He turns and is surprised to see Noah typing a text on his cell phone. JACKSON (CONT'D) Did mommy buy you that? NOAH No... Gordon gave it to me for my birthday. Jackson takes the phone from out of Noah's hands. JACKSON Noah. Things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family. NOAH (BITTER) What family? Jackson reads the message Noah has typed `Hey Gordon, Camping Sucks!'. Hurt, Jackson hands back the phone. JACKSON Go to sleep guys. EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK Commotion. The base packs up. Adrian and Prof. West duck low as they board a chopper. Adrian is on the phone. ADRIAN ... You have to immediately inform the President, Mr Anheuser. The readings look much worse than I expected. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 22. ADRIAN (CONT'D) Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from India confirm... We hear Anheuser, yelling. ANHEUSER (O.S.) ... But you guys said... ADRIAN We were wrong! By five or six months... A second later the chopper lifts off. INT. LIMO/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK Jackson has his laptop open with the cursor blinking away on the words `Chapter Seven'. But he can't concentrate on writing after what Noah has said. A chopper flies overhead. Jackson follows it's path over the campsite and his eyes fall on an American flag fluttering on top of a massive radio antennae. This belongs to an RV truck. Through the RV's window, Jackson sees the silhouette of Charlie Frost, the guy with the binoculars, speaking into a microphone. Curious, Jackson flicks on the radio and twists the dial. ON THE RADIO (Charlie's voice) ... We have a listener calling in. Bill from Cooke City, you're on the Charlie Frost Show. (Bill's voice) I wanted to know, where will this all start? Jackson is intrigued. He puts his laptop down. ON THE RADIO (CONT'D) (Charlie's voice) Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood, Ha-Ha! But seriously, they've got the earth cracking under their asses already, Bill. Jackson climbs out of his car and starts towards the RV. He can still hear the radio. ON THE RADIO (CONT'D) (Bill's voice) Our family believes in the gospel of our Lord Jesus. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 23. ON THE RADIO (CONT'D) We have nothing to fear, Charlie. (Charlie's voice) Good for you Bill, good for you! INT. CHARLIE'S RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK Charlie hits a switch. Music starts playing. The Doors, `The End'. CHARLIE FROST ... This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park, soon to become the world's largest active volcano. Charlie is about to take a bite of his sandwich, when there's a knock on the door. Jackson sticks his head in. JACKSON Hi. Mind if I join you? CHARLIE FROST I only got a few minutes. Charlie bites into his sandwich as Jackson looks around at all the equipment. JACKSON I just heard part of your broadcast... Mind me asking a question? What exactly is it... that will start in Hollywood? CHARLIE FROST (CHEWING) Actually it's gonna be the whole west coast... JACKSON What are you talking about? CHARLIE FROST The apocalypse, the end of days. The Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the Bible, kind of... Charlie looks at his watch. CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) I got to eat... Just check my blog. You can download it for free. Charlie clicks on his laptop. CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) ... However, we do take donations. (CONTINUED) 24. A crudely animated film starts to play. Charlie narrates on screen in an overly dramatic fashion. CHARLIE'S VOICE In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold. Caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640,000 years... Just imagine the earth as an Orange... Charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange. CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation, that the core of the earth will melt - that's the inside part of the Orange, leaving the crust of our planet free to shift. On screen the middle of the orange shrinks, now the skin moves freely around it. CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) In 1958, Prof. Hapgood named it `Earth Crust Displacement'... A faded portrait of a scientist appears on screen. CHARLIE FROST ... and Albert Einstein endorsed it... The infamous photo of Einstein, sticking out his tongue. CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) The forces of mother nature will be so devastating it will bring an end to this world on winter solstice 12-21-12. The film ends with an image of the whole earth covered with water. Charlie shuts the laptop. CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) Pretty neat, huh? It's a big hit on YouTube. I did the animation myself. (PAUSE) I know what you're thinking. But all the governments know about this. JACKSON If they all knew, don't you think somebody would tell us? (CONTINUED) 25. CHARLIE FROST They can't. Just think about it. First the stockmarket would crash... Charlie opens a can of beer. Phsssh! CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) Then the economy... boom. The dollar... boom. And then the people in the streets... (mimicking gun fire) Boom, boom! Pandemonium, revolution, war! They would never tell us. Beer? Jackson shakes his head still struggling to digest this. CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) Only if you're some Sheik, Bill Gates, or maybe one of those Russian billionaires do you stand a chance to buy a seat. JACKSON A seat? CHARLIE FROST (INTENSELY) They're building spaceships, man. JACKSON Oh... I see. CHARLIE FROST No really... One of my listeners, a geography professor at UTSC, has even figured out where they're building them. He sent me a map. JACKSON Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My kids are sleeping. Charlie looks at him bug eyed. CHARLIE FROST Get them out of Yellowstone, man. It's gonna get ugly here. JACKSON Night, Charlie. As Jackson exits, Charlie gets back on the air. (CONTINUED) 26. CHARLIE FROST Sorry for the delay, folks. But even in times like these, a man has got to eat... CUT TO: EXT. PARKING LOT OF SUPERMARKET/LOS ANGELES - NIGHT Westwood. The parking lot of Gelson's is nearly empty. Eerie silence. Suddenly some of the cars begin to shift in place from an unseen force. A small CRACK creases the asphalt and slowly crawls towards the brightly lit supermarket. INT. BETWEEN AISLES/SUPERMARKET - NIGHT Muzak is playing. Kate and her boyfriend Gordon are shopping late. She picks up some pull-ups for Lilly, Gordon steps up behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist. GORDON Why don't we make a baby? He reaches up and touches her breasts. KATE Stop it! We're in public. Gordon lets go of her with mock disappointment. GORDON Honey, I created them. And now suddenly I can't touch them? Kate pushes him away and moves on. A few customers are paying at the checkout stand. BEHIND THEM: Huge glass windows reveal cars slowly sliding into the ever widening crack in the parking lot. Nobody inside notices. Gordon catches up with Kate. GORDON (CONT'D) You always act strange after he shows up? KATE Just because I don't care for your arrogant humor doesn't mean I'm acting strange. He is the father of my kids. (CONTINUED) 27. GORDON Maybe biologically. Can I remind you what that guy did? First you gave up med school to have Noah... Then you practically raise him and Lilly by yourself while he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk. KATE Some of his stuff is actually... He's published Gordon. GORDON (MOCKINGLY) Yeah, published! You know your mother was right. You've always been drawn to guys with lofty dreams and empty pockets. But not this time right, sweetheart? Kate smiles awkwardly and picks up a can of soup. The shelf in front of her shakes for a moment. KATE Did you see that? GORDON See what? Kate slowly puts the cans of soup into her cart and looks around. Gordon senses a problem between them. GORDON (CONT'D) You know Kate, we have to keep working at this... our relationship. Because I won't end up being just a re-run of you and Jackson. (PAUSE) I mean Honey, I feel like... something is pulling us apart? Before Gordon finishes his sentence-- A violent ROAR! From front to back, the entire supermarket rips open right between Kate and Gordon. The few customers scream in horror at the sight of the huge crevasse forming beneath them. Kate and Gordon are thrown up against opposite aisles holding on for dear life. They cling to the columns as the shelves fold into the ever widening crack... CUT TO: 28. INT. CONVENIENCE STORE/YELLOWSTONE - MORNING Jackson puts down some groceries at the checkout. JACKSON Just stop scratching. You'll get them infected. He smiles at the female cashier behind the counter who does not look friendly. JACKSON (CONT'D) Something for Mosquito bites please? CASHIER Before or after? JACKSON What? The woman looks at Lilly and Noah with their red lumps. CASHIER I'd get before and after. She slams two mosquito products on the counter. LILLY (POINTING) Look! Mrs. Birnbaum, my teacher is on TV! On the store's TV: A heavy-set blonde WOMAN, 45, speaking to a reporter in front of Gelson's. NOAH That's our supermarket. The gap in the ground is enormous now, at least half a mile long and 200 feet wide. JACKSON (WORRIED) Kids, we have to pack up and go find mommy. CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING President Wilson and Anheuser walk towards the Situation Room. (CONTINUED) 29. ANHEUSER Sir, you have to initiate the boarding process immediately. PRESIDENT WILSON Is this even possible? What's our information from China? ANHEUSER They estimate four of the ships will be ready for launch. The President is shocked by this news. PRESIDENT WILSON Only four? ANHEUSER If it's alright with you sir, I'll brief the panel about the new development. PRESIDENT WILSON I'd rather have Adrian do that. They trust him. I told him to be in on the meeting. Anheuser fumes as they enter the situation room. INT. SITUATION ROOM/WHITE HOUSE - MORNING Flat screens line the walls. A video conference is under way with each of the G8 members represented. PRESIDENT WILSON Ladies and Gentlemen, we all knew this day would come. But we never imagined it would come this soon. He looks over to Adrian. PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) I would like to pass this over to my science advisor, Adrian Helmsley. Adrian steps up and gathers himself. Anheuser watches. ADRIAN I'll make this brief... Pointing to a set of charts. (CONTINUED) 30. ADRIAN (CONT'D) ... According to our latest data from Yellowstone, the temperature of the subterranean crust of the earth, the cement that holds our landmass in place, is increasing at a rapid rate, much faster than anticipated... All the heads of state are glued to his words. ADRIAN (CONT'D) ... This causes extreme polar instability. The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80% over the last 48 hours. The German Chancellor, a woman, interrupts. GERMAN CHANCELLOR How much time do we have, Mr. Helmsley? Adrian glances to Professor West, standing in the back. ADRIAN Two, maybe three days if we're lucky. The Prime Minister of Italy breaks in, upset. ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER How can you speak about luck in such a situation? ANHEUSER Apologies Prime minster. He's still new to the job. President Wilson steps up. PRESIDENT WILSON Nevertheless, Mr. Antonioni, we have to make an immediate decision. We hear CHEERING and APPLAUSE. BOXING ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Introducing the 320 pound muscle machine from the Ukraine... CUT TO: INT. BOXING ARENA OF MGM GRAND/LAS VEGAS - NIGHT The arena is filled to its max. The crowd is on its feet. (CONTINUED) 31. BOXING ANNOUNCER ... and tonight's challenger for the heavy weight world championship of the world. Here he is... Mister Zultan Balashin! The crowd ROARS as the boxer and his entourage enter. The CAMERA moves in on a tall man with blonde clean cut hair. He is well built, wearing designer clothing from head to toe. YURI KARPOV, 45, stereotypical Russian oligarch. He approaches the ringside corner and whistles. YURI Zultan! The nervous boxer turns. ZULTAN (in Russian) Ah, finally, Yuri. I thought I would not see you. Yuri hits the boxer's gloves. Zultan is nervous. His coach steps in. COACH He needs to concentrate now, Mister Karpov. YURI You shut up... when I talk to my boy, understand? COACH Yes, Mr. Karpov. YURI Good... That is good. (in Russian to the BOXER) Zultan my friend. Do not forget. We are fighters. We never go down. We always stay on our feet... Zultan just keeps nodding, pumping himself up. YURI (CONT'D) ... No matter who is hitting us. No matter how hard. GONG. First Round. The fight is on. YURI (CONT'D) Now, go kill the bastard. (CONTINUED) 32. Yuri walks to his seat, sitting down next to his trophy: TAMARA, 28, blonde, wears the shortest mini one can imagine, designer shoes, handbag, glasses and boobs. In her lap she holds CAESAR, a tiny dog wearing a diamond collar. In the ring the boxers maul at each other. Yuri's cell phone beeps. It's a text message: START BOARDING PROCEDURE Yuri's whole demeanor changes. Without a word, he gets up and walks out of the arena. TAMARA Yuri bear... where are you going? Yuri does not respond as he squeezes through the crowd. Zultan, the boxer, notices Yuri leave. In that split second distraction, he is hit HARD and goes down for the count. The crowd ROARS! CUT TO: EXT. WESTWOOD/LOS ANGELES - SUNRISE Jackson has driven all night. The sun rises, a giant glowing orb. PUBLIC RADIO NEWS (O.S.) ... Caltech believes that the incident in the Westwood supermarket has released most of the surface tension... EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING Jackson pulls up. The kids are asleep. PUBLIC RADIO NEWS (O.S.) ... It looks like life in the city will soon be back to normal, Mayor Gonzales said at an early morning news conference from his home in Hancock Park. Jackson switches off the radio and wakes his kids gently. JACKSON Lilly, we're home sweetie. (to Noah) Wake up big man. (CONTINUED) 33. Kate heads to the car. Still sleepy, the kids grab their stuff and run into her arms. KATE Oh honey, I'm so glad you're back... And you too, darling. JACKSON We tried calling but - LILLY (O.S.) I'm hungry Mummy. KATE At least it looks like the Mosquitos ate well. She looks at Jackson and softens. KATE (CONT'D) Wanna come in? Gordon appears at the door. Jackson watches painfully as Noah runs and gives Gordon a big hug. His cellphone beeps with a message. YURI (O.S.) Where are you Curtis? INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE/LAS VEGAS - EARLY MORNING Yuri stands at a huge window overlooking the strip talking into his phone. JACKSON (O.S.) Back in Westwood, Mister Karpov. YURI Good. That is good. I'm sending the Gulfstream to pick up Alec and Oleg. Tamara hovers in the background packing her Louis Vuitton luggage. Caesar, her little dog, watches from the bed. TAMARA (in Russian) Tell him to bring Caesar's raincoat, it's in the Range Rover. Yuri brushes her off. 34. EXT. STREET/BEL AIR - MORNING While talking to Yuri, Jackson is standing in front of the open trunk, changing into his chauffeur suit. YURI (O.S.) Curtis, make sure you get my boys as fast you can. EXT. MANSION/BEL AIR - MORNING A palatial home. Completely gaudy. The twins, ALEC and OLEG, wait impatiently. They are 12 years old and wear identical clothing by Dior. ALEC Curtis, you are late. Jackson ignores him and starts throwing the luggage into the limo. The other twin notices his muddy sneakers. OLEG Careful with our stuff. Don't get it dirty. EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING Ahead of the limo a crowd has formed in the streets, singing songs and chanting about the end of days. A SKINNY MAN with a ponytail preaches from the scriptures. PREACHER ... There will be famines, pestilences and earthquakes, sayeth the Lord. Jackson has to maneuver through the people. Banners read: `Prepare for the End'-- 'You cannot escape his judgement'-- Alec looks up from his video game, annoyed. ALEC Curtis, can't you go faster? JACKSON Are you guys blind? I can't run people over. OLEG Why not? They're idiots anyway. Jackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look. 35. EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING Jackson stops in front of the Gulfstream. SASHA, 40, Yuri's Russian pilot is expecting them. SASHA Hey Jackson. Took you a while... Jackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage, dropping one of them on Alec's foot on purpose. ALEC Ouch! Be more careful! The other twin has noticed Jackson's intensions. He gets into his face. OLEG Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are going on a big ship. (PAUSE) We will live... and you will die. Oleg grins back at Jackson as the jet door closes. The Gulfstream taxis onto the runway. As Jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots across the tarmac. We hold on his face as it hits him like a ton of bricks: THE CRAZY RADIO HOST, CHARLIE FROST WAS RIGHT! Frantically Jackson looks around and spots a MAN in overalls working on a twin engine Cessna. He runs to him. JACKSON Where can I rent a plane? The man points to a shabby office building. CUT TO: INT. KITCHEN/LOS ANGELES - MORNING Kate is in her kitchen cooking breakfast for the kids. Gordon watches the Governor on the news. GOVERNOR (with Austrian ACCENT) ... just this morning my people at Caltech told me that in the last 36 hours we had basically zero earthquake activity in Southern California, which is very rare... (CONTINUED) 36. The phone rings. Kate picks up. EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING Jackson drives like crazy. JACKSON ... Kate, we have to get out of LA! I've rented a plane for us. Get the kids ready! I'll be there in five. KATE The kids have plans today... JACKSON Are you kidding me! KATE No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and Lil' has Karate. Gordon rolls his eyes and mutters. GORDON Not that we'd expect him to remember. JACKSON (SCREAMING) California is going down! Pack up the kids! KATE You're crazy! The Governor just said we're fine now. JACKSON The Governor's a meathead, how would he know anything? Kate listen! You gotta trust me over some politician. Come on. INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING Kate slams the phone down. Lilly stops eating. LILLY Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy? LAURA Because your daddy is a lunatic, darling. On the TV, the interview comes to an end. (CONTINUED) 37. GOVERNOR ... it looks to me, like the worst is over. That moment a MASSIVE QUAKE hits Los Angeles. Everybody dives under the table. ON TV: The news casters and the Governor do the same. A few seconds later the signal cuts out. Gordon pulls Kate and the kids close as the earth shakes violently for 20 seconds. EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING Jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house. INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING When he enters, Lilly immediately runs into his arms. The next tremor hits. Cracks form on the kitchen floor. JACKSON We have to leave! Noah, let's go! KATE I think we're safer here! JACKSON Noah, now! Kate please... The whole house rides up and down like on a wave. GORDON I think he's right. Finally Kate pushes her son out from under the table. They all scramble out of the house in a panic. Kate is cut on the shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices. EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING As they storm out of their front door the house crumbles behind them. JACKSON Get in the car! The whole street starts to buckle. Left and right the houses are shaken and smashed like toys. (CONTINUED) 38. Just before the wave of destruction can reach them, Jackson tears out of the driveway. EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING Jackson maneuver's the limo through the crumbling neighborhood. Right in front of their eyes, streets disappear, trees fall, electrical lines snap. Sewer pipes burst in front of the car. NOAH Holy shit! Jackson has to turn on the windshield wipers. EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING The limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac, coming to a stop in front of a twin engine Cessna. JACKSON Damn it! Where's the pilot? Kate turns to Gordon. KATE Gordon, you know how to fly. GORDON I... had a couple lessons... JACKSON Did you cover taking off? GORDON Yeah. JACKSON That's good enough for me. They start running, when Jackson remembers something and heads back to the Limo. He grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his laptop back inside it. Kate shouts. KATE (O.S.) Jackson, what are you doing? JACKSON I'm coming. He jumps out of the car and races back after them. Behind Jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate. (CONTINUED) 39. IN THE DISTANCE A gigantic fissure forms in the earth, shooting towards Santa Monica airport. Gordon fumbles with the controls, Jackson yells from the copilot seat. JACKSON (CONT'D) Come on, come on... GORDON (pointing at the INSTRUMENTS) But I'm supposed to check all these first... Jackson reaches over and slams Gordon's hand down and the plane lurches forward. As the Cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes down and explodes. Noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them. NOAH Guys, behind us! As the plane accelerates, the giant crack closes in on them. Gordon's hand trembles on the throttle control. Everybody screams on top of each other. EVERYBODY Gordon! Damn it! Lift off! Gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever. The plane almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them gives way. They hover for a moment, almost caught in mid-air as the widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the bowels of the earth. Gordon fights to maintain control but they begin to be pulled down. The daylight vanishes. Debris and mud smashes into the plane from all sides. The canyon walls erupt. GORDON I can't get it up! Taking desperate measures, Gordon nearly rips the control stick out of its joint - with a lurch the Cessna lifts out of the abyss. (CONTINUED) 40. They all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown Los Angeles! Like a roller coaster, Gordon manages to weave the little plane through the tumbling high rises. They dive one last time to evade the plummeting US BANK TOWER, the tallest building on the west coast. All are dead silent as they watch the whole of Los Angeles crumble beneath them. Kate covers Lilly's eyes. NOAH (in total shock) That was amazing, Gordon! Jackson looks at Kate and notices her cut. JACKSON Are you okay? KATE (brushing it off) I'm fine. How did you know this was gonna happen? JACKSON I didn't. (To Gordon) Do we have enough fuel to make it to Yellowstone? The plane veers off in a northeasterly direction. Behind them the destruction of Los Angeles continues. CUT TO: EXT. FREEDOM OF THE SEAS/PACIFIC - DAY The gigantic cruise ship plows through the Pacific. We hear lounge music... INT. BAR/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY Adrian's father Harry and his partner Tony are on stage. Harry on the piano, singing, Tony playing the bass. A waiter brings drinks. Water for Harry, and a brightly colored cocktail for Tony. WAITER You got fans Tony... (CONTINUED) 41. Tony raises his glass to two old ladies who are sitting at the bar. WAITER (CONT'D) There's a call for you Harry. Want me to take a message? HARRY (while still playing) I'll be right there. The waiter nods. A few more bars of music, then applause. HARRY (CONT'D) (into the microphone) Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Let's hear it for the one and only Tony Delgado... And I'm Harry Helmsley and we'll be back after a short pit stop. Applause. Harry rushes off stage. ADRIAN (O.S.) Dad... what I have to tell you is very serious... INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY Adrian is standing in a dark corner. Behind him people are packing up, carrying boxes. ADRIAN You remember when I told you about the dam in China? Well, it's happening much sooner than we anticipated. INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY Harry's face has turned serious. ADRIAN (O.S.) The President has ordered us to clear out the White House. HARRY Hah... About time someone cleaned up that mess. INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY Adrian fights back the tears. (CONTINUED) 42. ADRIAN Where are you, dad? What exactly is the course of the `Freedom' right now?... HARRY (O.S.) It's all good, Adrian. Don't worry about your old man. You have more important things to do now. INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY There's a tremor in Harry's voice. HARRY You know, your mom and I, we had a hell of a great life... and a hell of a great kid too. (PAUSE) And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship you know... Don't write your old man off, just yet. INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY A tear runs down Adrian's face. HARRY (O.S.) ... Besides, I could never leave Tony alone. You know how he can't keep decent time by himself. Pause. ADRIAN I love you, dad. INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY Harry bites his lip. HARRY Love you too, son. INT. BAR/CRUISE SHIP - DAY Back in the lounge, Tony has finished his cocktail. Harry walks up and hollers at the barkeeper. HARRY Hey Herb. Get me a double Jack on the rocks. (CONTINUED) 43. TONY After twenty-five years on the wagon? HARRY Why not? Who cares how long we do certain things? How long we drink booze, how long we talk to people... Or how long we don't talk to people. Harry grabs Tony by his shirt. TONY Woah!... Harry, what's the matter with you? Let's go. We're back on. Harry pulls him even closer. HARRY Call your kid, you stubborn old ass. (PAUSE) I'm not going back on that stage unless you promise to call him. WAITER (INTERRUPTING) Tony, the ladies are waiting for you. HARRY Promise me, Tony... please. Harry stares him down. TONY Yeah, maybe I should call him... Harry smiles, downs his bourbon and walks back on stage. CUT TO: INT. ADRIAN'S OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - DAY Adrian enters his office. The TV is on. NEWS ANCHOR ... There is little we know at this point, but the earthquake registered at 10.1 on the Richter scale. The whole of the Western seaboard was hit... Assistants stare at the news in shocked disbelief, some of them are crying. Prof. West appears at the door. ADRIAN (pointing at the TV) Have you seen this? (CONTINUED) 44. Prof. West silently nods and beckons Adrian, who follows him down the hall into a dark control room. They look at a wall- sized high def monitor. PROF. WEST We have satellite images. Here's the sequence we've got so far. On the monitors, detailed satellite imagery displays how the monstrous quake unfolds, leaving California sliding into the sea. ADRIAN Any news from Yellowstone? PROF. WEST Anytime now. CUT TO: EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY The base is abandoned but for a few structures and the enormous drilling tower. Gordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a fueling station. Jackson leaps out checking the pump. JACKSON Guys, there's fuel! Fill her up and I'll look for Charlie. KATE You're sure about this? JACKSON Kate, everything this guy said so far has happened. I'll be right back. Jackson runs off towards the hills. LILLY Daddy wait! I wanna come with you! Lilly runs after him. Jackson picks her up. KATE Lilly! Come back! JACKSON It's fine! I'll take her. Kate watches as they disappear, worried. Noah and Gordon have started to fuel the plane. 45. EXT. CHARLIE'S RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Jackson and Lilly find Charlie's RV with it's door hanging open. They enter. The key is in the ignition. The radio transmitters are on, but Charlie is gone. Jackson fiddles with the switches and Charlie's voice comes on. CHARLIE'S VOICE ... I am standing here at the highest point on what is the rim of this super volcano... JACKSON He's got to be close by, Lil'bee... Jackson jumps behind the wheel and turns the ignition. LILLY Let's go back, Daddy. JACKSON Listen to me. We have to find Charlie. He's got a secret map, you know, like Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'. That catches her interest. JACKSON (CONT'D) Lil', we have to work as a team now, okay? You have to help me. Jackson passes her his mobile phone. Lilly nods. He throws the RV into gear and they speed off over the bumpy terrain. In their dust, we see the earth fissuring! INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Jackson drives like a bat out of hell. CHARLIE'S VOICE ... The last time this baby blew, was 640,000 years ago... JACKSON Dial Mommy's number, sweetheart. Jackson tears up the mountain looking for Charlie. EXT. EMPTY ARMY BASE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Kate's phone rings. (CONTINUED) 46. LILLY (O.S.) Hi mommy... KATE Where are you, honey!? INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Jackson hears the stress in Kate's voice. He hisses at Lilly. JACKSON Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes. LILLY (EXCITED) We're looking for a secret map, mommy. Jackson grimaces. EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Kate tries to keep it together for Lilly. KATE Let me speak to your daddy, darling. LILLY (O.S.) Daddy can't talk right now, he's driving really fast... INT. RV/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY The RV runs over a boulder. Lilly hits the roof. LILLY Ouch! KATE (O.S.) LILLY! In the background Kate hears the voice of Charlie Frost. CHARLIE'S VOICE ... I tell you guys, any minute now... any minute the fireworks will start... KATE (O.S.) Who's in the car with you? Who's that man screaming? LILLY He's not in the car. He's on a mountain waiting for fireworks. (CONTINUED) 47. Lilly spots Charlie way up on a ridge. He has erected his ten foot radio antenna with the flag fluttering on top. LILLY (CONT'D) (to Jackson) There he is! Up there! JACKSON You're the best, darling. Give Daddy the phone... (into the phone) Kate I am sorry, I can't talk... The road ends just below the mountain peak. KATE (O.S.) Bring back my child, Jackson! NOW! Jackson sees Charlie up above, broadcasting. He hangs up the phone and jumps out of the RV. JACKSON You wait here for me! You watch the ship while Captain Curtis talks to the pirate. Okay? LILLY (UNCERTAIN) Okay... Jackson climbs up to Charlie. EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Charlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body. The antenna's flag is whipping in the wind. CHARLIE FROST (into his mic) ... I wish you guys at home could see this on TV... He notices Jackson and muffles the microphone. CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) How did you make it up here? Thought you were toast. JACKSON The spaceships Charlie, where are they? CHARLIE FROST You can't make it there. (CONTINUED) 48. JACKSON We have a plane. We can get you out of here too. Let's go Charlie! All around the landscape begins to collapse. A three mile crater forms, revealing the awe-inspiring sight of the super- volcano. CHARLIE FROST You'll never make it out in time. Just stay and enjoy the big bang. That your kid? Jackson discovers Lilly standing behind him, staring at Charlie with her big brown eyes. Jackson grabs Charlie lifting him off the ground. JACKSON Where is that god damn map! CHARLIE FROST Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't know. Somewhere in my camper. A low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as MILLIONS OF BIRDS tear into flight. CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) Wow! Look at that!... (into his mic) Fly birdies fly! This marks the last day of the United States of America folks and by tomorrow... The mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing molten lava underneath. CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D) ... the last of mankind. Soon they'll see us from a million miles away, out there in the milky way... Jackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the mountain. EXT. BELOW MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Jackson and Lilly jump into the RV and races off, with Charlie's broadcast still playing. CHARLIE'S VOICE ... The ash cloud will travel everywhere. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 49. CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) First the lights will go out in Vegas, then Dallas, St. Louis and then Washington DC... Jackson's cell phone rings and he picks up. JACKSON We're on our way. EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY KATE Jackson, things are really looking bad here! In that instant, the air around them vanishes, as if sucked from the landscape into a vacuum. THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN... At least in the last 640,000 years. To them, all this occurs in total silence. The sound of the eruption has not reached them yet. They are frozen, unable to comprehend what is happening. EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY The explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom. CHARLIE FROST ... it's beautiful, kids! Just beautiful! The sound waves reach Charlie, throwing him to the ground. EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY The RV flies over the rugged terrain. Everywhere the earth is cracking, falling apart. Jackson struggles to swerve around the disappearing landscape. LILLY (SCREAMING) It's following us! Lilly has discovered the expanding ASH CLOUD behind them. JACKSON Just don't look back, Lil'bee! The THUNDERING sound envelopes them! On the radio, the voice of Charlie is getting shrill. (CONTINUED) 50. CHARLIE'S VOICE Majestic!... Oh yeah! EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Charlie slowly tries to stand again, silhouetted against the cloud of dust and fire towering above him. Flaming rocks fly towards him. When they hit the ground, they detonate like fire bombs. CHARLIE'S VOICE Oh baby! It's coming! EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Rocks plummet like comets around the RV as Jackson races over a collapsing bridge. On the radio, in his delirious state, Charlie begins to sing... CHARLIE'S VOICE `This is the end, my friend'... Yellowstone looks like a war zone. The RV dodges the bombardment of fire and rock. EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY Huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at Charlie through the ashes. He screams at the top of his lungs. CHARLIE FROST ... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie. A second later, Charlie's radio antenna comes spinning like a scythe through the air. It decapitates Charlie in an instant. EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY The radio cuts out. The forest and the camp grounds are mown flat by the extreme force of the ASH CLOUD. In the rear view mirror Jackson sees it gaining on them. JACKSON LILLY! DOWN! A firebomb hits the RV, ripping half the roof off. Lilly barely makes it under the dashboard. (CONTINUED) 51. JACKSON (CONT'D) Stay down there, Lil'! We're almost there! Just keep looking at daddy. Jackson spots the little Cessna in the distance. EXT. EMPTY ARMY BASE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY At the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms, cutting the RV off from reaching the plane. Lilly sticks out her head. LILLY Mommy! Jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack, sending Lilly flying out. Without thinking, he lets go of the wheel, lunging after her and pulling her back inside. JACKSON Stay down darling. Jackson races the RV alongside the forming crack. Spotting a narrow point in the crevasse, he makes a decision. Slamming the accelerator down, he races towards it at full speed. Moments later the RV is airborne! Kate watches, too shocked to scream. A few drawn out seconds. Then the RV touches down, crashing 200 feet from the plane. Kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper. Lilly jumps out, racing into her mom's arms. Jackson turns and sees the cloud approaching. JACKSON (CONT'D) You guys go! I'll be right there! Kate pulls Lilly back to the plane. Jackson jumps into the back of the RV scavenging through the shelves, looking for Charlie's map. Kate lifts Lilly onto the wing of the plane. Gordon revs up the engines. NOAH Give me your hand, Lil'. Noah pulls his little sister into the cockpit. (CONTINUED) 52. Fiery rocks rain from the sky, detonating to the right and left of their plane as Kate climbs in. GORDON We have to take off! NOAH No! LILLY Where's daddy?! GORDON Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll all die! Gordon pushes the throttle. The plane starts to move. Kate screams. KATE Gordon! Wait! Back in the RV, Jackson is frantically going through the masses of books and papers on the shelves. Finally, a map. He unfolds it. But it's only of the London underground system. He throws it to the ground and finds another. This time he's lucky! There are markings everywhere. As he races to the door, the ground gives way beneath the RV. Kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight. KATE (CONT'D) JACKSON! NO! Noah begins to cry and Lilly clings to her mom. Gordon just stares, paralyzed. The ASH CLOUD is almost upon them! Gordon takes action and accelerates the plane. Kate turns back. A hand emerges from the crevasse. Then another, holding a map. Her face lights up. LILLY It's daddy! Jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them, the map in his hand. KATE Jackson! Here! Kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him. (CONTINUED) 53. NOAH Faster Dad. You can make it! GORDON Kate, grab him for god sake. We're almost out of runway. Using every last ounce of energy, Jackson leaps onto the wing and is yanked into the plane by Kate. Just at that moment, the plane lifts off. Jackson falls into the cockpit, completely out of breath. Lilly crawls over and hugs him. JACKSON Thanks for waiting guys. Now all eyes are glued to the speedometer. 180... 190... The violent ASH CLOUD is hitting their tail rudder. The plane swerves wildly! Gordon gets it back under control. The speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the CLOUD slowly falls back. Everybody breathes a sigh of relief. KATE So, now that you got your map, where are we going? Jackson unfolds it and takes a look. Hundreds of markings clutter the map. In the left corner he discovers a large letter C followed by H - I - N - A. He looks up. JACKSON We're gonna need a bigger plane. CUT TO: INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON The White House is being evacuated. Amidst the chaos stands Anheuser. Adrian puts down a phone and looks at him. ADRIAN Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6. We have strong easterly winds... ANHEUSER And the crustal displacement? (CONTINUED) 54. ADRIAN No one knows, sir. Anheuser starts walking, Adrian trails behind. ANHEUSER Let's get the government airborne and... I mean now. INT. OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON Anheuser and Adrian burst into the Anteroom of the Oval Office. The President's secretary, SALLY, 55, is packing. ANHEUSER Where is the President, Sally? Sally looks up stone faced. SALLY He said he wanted to spend a few minutes alone. I think he's over at the chapel. ANHEUSER The whole North American continent is about to perish, and Wilson decides to go to church! Adrian shoots an angry look at Anheuser. ADRIAN He's praying sir. Which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea. ANHEUSER Maybe. But right now I need the leader of the free world off his knees and on Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours. Can I leave that with you Helmsley? Anheuser walks away. Adrian and Sally exchange a look. SALLY I really don't like that man. INT. CHAPEL/WHITE HOUSE - SUNSET Adrian finds the President standing near the front of the chapel. ADRIAN Mr. President? We need to get you out of Washington immediately. (CONTINUED) 55. President Wilson stays with his head bowed. PRESIDENT WILSON Now matter how idealistic you are taking office. You lose your innocence behind that desk. (PAUSE) Laura was right. People have died because of the decisions I made. ADRIAN That's not your fault sir. He turns to face Adrian. PRESIDENT WILSON You sound like Anheuser. This quietly affects Adrian. PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Laura's never looked at me like that before. Only once... When I told her, her mother had died. You knew the first lady? ADRIAN A little. PRESIDENT WILSON You know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital? (PAUSE) `Tommy... I think you should do a lottery. Every one should have a chance to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me. That's what we should have done. ADRIAN There would have been chaos, sir. President Wilson looks Adrian in the eyes. PRESIDENT WILSON You know what I believe, Adrian. I believe nature should choose for itself, from itself. Adrian takes this in. PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Don't let her go. You'll regret it if you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a man you are. And I'll do the same... You go now. And watch your back for Anheuser. (CONTINUED) 56. Adrian stares at the President in disbelief. ADRIAN But sir? PRESIDENT WILSON Go. That's an order Helmsley. A tense moment before Adrian starts to walk away. Just as he exits the chapel, Wilson calls after him. PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D) Would you tell my daughter... there's nothing on earth that I cherish more than her. We hold on President Wilson's face. CUT TO: EXT. LAS VEGAS - SUNSET Most of Las Vegas is destroyed. A 200 foot wide canyon now divides sin city along its famous strip. The towering casinos still teeter along the canyon's rim. All forms of emergency rescue operations are deployed around the city. In the FOREGROUND, we see Las Vegas International Airport, its runway cut dramatically short. Large pieces of tarmac continue to break off into the crevasse. EXT. AIRFIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - SUNSET Gordon maneuvers his plane through the chaos. Airplanes are strewn about the runway. Passengers everywhere. GORDON I told you we should have gone to my parents' in the Rockies. KATE Gordon's right. Look at this mess. Jackson looks around frantically. JACKSON You don't understand, it's our only chance. (CONTINUED) 57. GORDON This isn't one of your crazy stories now. How the hell are we gonna make it to China? NOAH Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never have made it out of California. Silence. Noah is right and they know it. They taxi past a private jet whose front wheel is stuck in a hole in the tarmac. We hear a dog barking and the CAMERA finds Tamara, with Caesar in her arms. YURI (O.S.) Careful with the landing gear! (in Russian) Tamara, get the boys out of the way! An airport tow truck attempts to pull Yuri's Gulfstream jet out. Sasha, the pilot, helps. A safety announcement echoes through the whole area. VOICE (over loudspeaker) Attention! The US National Guard has informed us, that an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed towards the city of Las Vegas. Tamara looks scared and secretly reaches for Sasha's hand. They share an intimate look, no one else sees. VOICE (CONT'D) We strongly advise every one to move indoors immediately... The tow truck driver panics and runs inside. We move in on Yuri. For the first time he looks helpless. In the background, Jackson and his family join the panicked crowd heading towards the terminal building. Firemen and rescue workers usher them forward. FIRE MAN Let's move people! Inside the terminal! Jackson and his family are swept along. CUT TO: 58. INT. AIR FORCE ONE/ARLINGTON AIRPORT - DUSK Adrian rushes up the stairs of Air Force One, approaching one of the flight officers. ADRIAN Where's Anheuser? OFFICER In the command center, sir. Adrian moves on. INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DUSK Adrian enters. Anheuser immediately senses something is amiss. ADRIAN The President is not coming. I couldn't convince him to. Everyone in the room looks up, speechless. ANHEUSER So, the captain doesn't want to leave his sinking ship? (PAUSE) Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned that the Vice President's chopper crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta. Adrian is shocked. ADRIAN What about the Speaker of the House? ANHEUSER In this chaos... I have no idea! ADRIAN But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir, I just think - Anheuser moves in dangerously close. ANHEUSER I don't care what you think, Helmsley. Laura quietly enters the Command Center, as Anheuser and Adrian stare each other down. (CONTINUED) 59. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Your ass only made it into the White House, because your old man knew the First Lady... and because of all that affirmative action bullshit. Anheuser takes it even further. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) There was a white kid, much more qualified than you. Just so you know. Adrian's face is ashen. LAURA (O.S.) Where is my father? Everyone turns to Laura. Silence. ADRIAN He wanted to stay with his people. Suddenly, the engines of Air Force One turn over. Laura panics. LAURA We have to go back! Adrian tries to hold her close to him. Anheuser sees this intimate moment and gives a suspicious, questioning look. A second later Laura pushes Adrian away. LAURA (CONT'D) Let me get out. Mr. Anheuser - tell the Captain. ANHEUSER There is a protocol for just this situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid we'll have to follow it to the letter. Anheuser turns to an officer. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Tell the Captain, to take off immediately. Laura looks at him incredulously. CUT TO: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK Emergency lights illuminate the densely populated terminal. (CONTINUED) 60. RESCUE WORKER People, stay away from the windows! One of the rescue workers yells, pushing Jackson and his family back. Frustrated, Jackson turns to Kate and Gordon. JACKSON We can't get stuck here. Suddenly a voice... VOICE (O.S.) Dr. Silberman? What are you doing here? They all turn and stare at Tamara, holding her little dog against her plump breasts. Kate gives Gordon a look. GORDON (EMBARRASSED) She's a patient, honey. JACKSON (SARCASTICALLY) Nice work. But when Jackson discovers Yuri behind her, his tone suddenly changes. He gets in Yuri's face. JACKSON (CONT'D) You bastard. You knew it all along! (at the twins) You and those spoiled rotten sons of yours... Sasha comes running in and cuts through this. SASHA I found us a plane, an Antonov. They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them. YURI Can you still fly that thing? SASHA Sure... But I need a copilot. Lilly chimes in. LILLY Gordon is a pilot. (CONTINUED) 61. Before Gordon can protest Jackson picks up Lilly. JACKSON Let's go! They burst through the emergency exit, setting off an alarm. Emergency personnel yell after them. RESCUE WORKER Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come back! But they keep on running. Sasha now leads the way. EXT. AIR FIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK They race around the corner and come to a halt. Before them, a Russian freight plane of enormous size-- The ANTONOV 225, the biggest aircraft in the world. NOAH Wow, that is a big plane. YURI (PROUDLY) It's Russian. Sasha, who has run ahead turns back and sees: A MASSIVE GREY WALL OF ASH moving towards the airport. SASHA Guys, follow me! They all run after him up the stairs. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK Sasha enters the cockpit and puts on the headset while readying the plane for takeoff. SASHA (into the mic) You'll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold... INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK SASHA (O.S.) ... Sit down and buckle up! They all scramble to get into their seats. (CONTINUED) 62. NOAH Wow! Look at those! They discover the cargo they are carrying-- Sports cars, SUV's, concept cars and luxury models, some of them are labeled `Las Vegas Auto Show 2012'. YURI We had VIP tickets for that. The six engines of the Antonov come roaring to life. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK The plane is starting to move. Gordon sits uncomfortably in the copilot's seat. SASHA You check the main bus for the hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks. GORDON Uh... What? Sasha reaches over and does it himself. SASHA Work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel, okay? Gordon nods and puts on the headset, trying to focus. INT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK People start SCREAMING, when they discover the menacing WALL OF ASH racing towards them. RESCUE WORKER Move back, people... down on the floor! EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK The nose of the Antonov turns onto the runway. This humongous plane suddenly looks small against the wall of ash. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK Gordon is panicking. GORDON We have to get going! (CONTINUED) 63. Sasha hits the throttle. SASHA (CALM) We're going, we're going. A deafening THUNDER emanates from the engines. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK Everybody grabs their seat as the vibration of the aircraft builds. EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK The Antonov steadily gains speed as it rumbles down the cracked and uneven runway. The canyon that has swallowed half the city looms ahead. And behind them the volcanic cloud bears down. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK Sasha stares down the gap ahead, determined. Gordon's face is as white as a sheet. GORDON We're not gonna make it! SASHA Shut up! We will! INT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK The violent cloud has finally reached the airport. The terminals are hit by flying debris. Seconds later, Yuri's Gulfstream is whipped through the air, shattering the huge windows into a thousand pieces. People are thrown like rag dolls as the jet explodes in a massive fireball. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK Kate and Jackson hold their kids tight. Tamara clings to little Caesar and Yuri to his twins. 64. EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK The Antonov lumbers heavily towards the inevitable drop off on the horizon. The runway is way too short... And to make matters worse, the ground begins to move again, slowly arching the tarmac upwards, creating a crooked ramp at the end of it. INT. COCKPIT/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK A drop of sweat trickles down Sasha's forehead as he pulls back the wheel. Gordon holds on for dear life as the huge plane barely lifts off, veering sideways. EXT. CANYON/LAS VEGAS - DUSK The Antonov is on a collision course with the crumbling casino towers along the other side of the rim. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK SASHA GOVNO! (shit). Help me pull! Gordon grabs the wheel on his side, helping Sasha pull up the beast of a plane. EXT. CANYON RIM/LAS VEGAS - DUSK Very slowly the plane starts to rise and Sasha's face lights up. They barely make it over a casino called `Paris; Las Vegas'. But the plane clips its wheels on a high metal structure right behind it, ripping away part of the landing gear. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK After some struggle, Sasha manages to steady the Antonov. Gordon's face is green as he looks back. GORDON Was that the Eiffel Tower? Sasha looks over and grins. He grabs the microphone. (CONTINUED) 65. SASHA Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way to China. CUT TO: EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY An ancient monastery built atop a solitary mountain rock. In the distance, the sun glistens off the peaks of the Himalayas. NENG PANG, a young monk, 20, sits with his superior and teacher LAMA YAK LA, 65. They have tea beneath a huge bronze bell. LAMA YAK LA (in Chinese) Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it, Neng. NENG But Lin is my brother. He is working inside the big tunnels, where the ships are made. The Lama remains silent. NENG (CONT'D) What is in your wisdom for us to do, great Lama... if Lin is right, if our world is indeed coming to an end? Instead of answering, the Lama serves him more tea. When the cup is full, the Lama doesn't stop pouring. Neng watches the tea overflow until he can no longer restrain himself. NENG (CONT'D) It's full, great Lama. It can hold no more! The Lama stops pouring and looks at Neng. LAMA YAK LA Like this cup, Neng, you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you wisdom unless you first empty your cup? Neng bows his head in embarrassment. The Lama smiles to himself and takes a chain from around his neck. On it hangs a set of rusty car keys. (CONTINUED) 66. LAMA YAK LA (CONT'D) Be careful with the clutch. It tends to slide. The Lama throws him the keys and the young monk catches them, smiling from ear to ear. They bow to each other and Neng runs off. Lama Yak La looks after him as a father would. He gets up and strikes the bronze bell with a wooden mallet. EXT. HOUSING PROJECT/TIBET - DAY As far as you can see is a series of identical little houses. The house in the foreground has a chicken coop in the garden. Mrs. Pang enters the coop. We last saw her when the village was being evacuated. She grabs one of the hens. She places its head on a woodblock and picks up a rusty hatchet. Just about to strike, she hears a strange RATTLING noise. An old truck comes driving towards the house. Behind the wheel sits her son Neng. She puts down the hatchet, yelling. MRS. PANG (in Chinese) Bata! Neng is coming! The young monk jumps out, quickly bowing. NENG Mother, I got a message from Lin. He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at the west gate. He says he can get us on one of the ships he is working on. Mrs. Pang is still holding the chicken by its throat. MRS. PANG I thought Lin is working on the dam? NENG The dam is a ship, Mother. The government lied to us. There will be a big flood. The chicken hangs limp in Mrs. Pang's hand. MRS. PANG Not here in the mountains... Let's eat first. The hen panics as she puts its head back on the block, raising the hatchet again. (CONTINUED) 67. NENG No mother! We must pack up right away. NENG'S MOTHER We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry once. Your father was throwing up the whole way. The door opens and Mr. Pang appears. MR. PANG Neng, I did not know you were coming for dinner. At that moment the hatchet drops with a THUD! CUT TO: EXT. ANTONOV/OVER THE PACIFIC - NIGHT The majestic Antonov is flying high in the Pacific skies. OLEG (O.S.) Look, the new Bentley. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - NIGHT The boys are exploring the huge freight deck. Caesar, the little dog, is traipsing along. Alec, Oleg and Noah marvel at a stylish mixture of luxury and performance cars. ALEC Our dad had one on order. We were supposed to get it next year. OLEG But then he cancelled it again, because of the ships. Noah points to a 2012 Aston Martin parked further back. NOAH If I was rich, I'd get one of those. OLEG We have one. How many cars does your family have? NOAH My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a Carrera 4. (CONTINUED) 68. ALEC Our parents are divorced too. The boys share a moment of understanding. NOAH Nothing we can do about that. Noah reaches for the door of the Bentley. To his surprise, it opens. NOAH (CONT'D) Wow... look at this. Noah jumps into the car. KATE (O.S.) Be careful, Noh'! Kate and Lilly are still belted in next to Tamara. Jackson and Yuri sit on the other side of the Antonov. TAMARA How did you meet Dr. Silberman? He's great, isn't he? KATE I think for the same reasons you did. You know, after breast feeding two kids... Kate looks at Tamara. KATE (CONT'D) Did your husband ask you to get your's done? TAMARA We are not married. And we probably never will... But he paid for them. KATE I bet he did. They laugh. LILLY What did the man pay for mommy? KATE Nothing, Lil'bee. Kate looks over at Jackson who's trying to make sense of Charlie's map. Tamara catches her looking. (CONTINUED) 69. TAMARA What's your situation? Kate lets out a sigh. KATE Way too complicated... On the other side of the plane, Yuri has been watching the two women talk. YURI They seem to like each other. JACKSON I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how much did you pay? YURI One billion euro, per seat. JACKSON That's disgusting. YURI You know Curtis, I wasn't always businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only playing when I was a boy, back in Murmansk. My coach... (SMILING) ... his name also Yuri... He always said: `Someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first'. Yuri puts his hand on Jackson's shoulder. YURI (CONT'D) What would you have done, if you rich like me? Just look at your gorgeous kids. And call me Yuri... Yuri offers his hand but Jackson doesn't shake it. Sasha's voice comes over the radio. SASHA (O.S.) Hi guys. The plan is to refuel in Hawaii. So, buckle up... Gordon and I will do the rest. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT Gordon turns to Sasha. (CONTINUED) 70. GORDON Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just took some lessons to overcome my fear of flying. SASHA Why did you give up? GORDON It didn't work. Gordon points to the declining altimeter. GORDON (CONT'D) What about the wheels we lost at take- off? SASHA There's 14 on each side. Some of them must still be there. With that, Sasha commences the landing procedure. EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT The Antonov dives into a thick layer of clouds. SASHA (O.S.) Still nothing from the tower? INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT Gordon shakes his head. The two pilots stare ahead watching as the clouds slowly change color, from yellow... to orange. They stare out the window in disbelief. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - NIGHT Gordon comes climbing down the metal ladder whispering to Jackson and Yuri. GORDON Guys, you really oughta take a look at this. Jackson and Yuri follow Gordon back into the cockpit. The women exchange a worried glance. 71. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT When Jackson and Yuri enter, they don't believe their eyes. YURI What is that? SASHA The State of Hawaii! YURI Not good. That is not good. EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT From above we watch as the Antonov flies over an endless ocean of fiery red lava. The Islands of Hawaii have turned into one big volcano. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT JACKSON How much fuel do we have? SASHA Not enough. We'll have to make a water landing somewhere in the South China Sea. GORDON At least we won't need our landing gear. Yuri wonders. YURI What about it? GORDON We lost it all... in Vegas. EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT The damaged landing gear slowly retracts into the vast belly of the Antonov as it veers off to the east. CUT TO: INT. PRESIDENTIAL CABIN/AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT Adrian knocks quietly and sticks his head around the door. Laura is sitting in her father's chair. (CONTINUED) 72. ADRIAN Can I come in? LAURA I've got nothing to say to you. ADRIAN But I do... Adrian enters. He has his travel bag in one hand. He looks at Laura and gathers himself. ADRIAN (CONT'D) Your Dad and I... we were trying to protect you. LAURA (EXPLODING) I'm a big girl Adrian. I don't need protection. You used me. You guys had me gallivanting around the world, as part of your little cover-up. ADRIAN But you were doing a good job. LAURA Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or Picasso. But if you're some young talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're not famous enough. People like you and Anheuser and my father - you think you can play God. Adrian takes a moment, he's desperate to make her see. ADRIAN You know what your father believed. That nature will choose itself from itself. LAURA That's bullshit and you know it. It's the fittest, the richest and the strongest that survive. ADRIAN That's not true. Adrian glances down and spots Jackson's book poking out of his bag. (CONTINUED) 73. ADRIAN (CONT'D) What would you say were the chances of a first time, middle-aged writer, who barely sold 500 copies of his novel making it on board this plane? LAURA Zero. What's your point? Adrian pulls out the book from his bag. He shows her. ADRIAN It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now. Laura takes this in. The plane's intercom cuts through the moment. INTERCOM (O.S.) Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your presence immediately. Adrian takes a breath, but before he leaves - ADRIAN What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me... Laura looks at him sadly, but with a little hope. LAURA I need to know that too, Adrian. Adrian moves for the door. He stops. ADRIAN One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... You are to me too. As Adrian exits, we hold on Laura's conflicted face. CUT TO: EXT. WHITE HOUSE/WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT The cloud from the Yellowstone eruption has hit Washington D.C. hard. Pennsylvania Avenue resembles a war zone. A ten inch layer of ash lies on the ground. The gates of the White House are wide open, with ash-covered rescue workers running about, resembling ghosts. 74. INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT The President has turned the whole West Wing into a shelter. He walks through the packed rooms assisting where he can. An old African-American LADY holds a crying young girl. President Wilson kneels down to her. OLD LADY She can't find her mother. PRESIDENT Why don't you two girls make yourself comfy on that big couch? I'll see what I can do. The child nods. The President gets up. PRESIDENT WILSON Sally, can you take care of them. I'll go check with the Red Cross... As he leaves, the old lady looks up at Sally and smiles. OLD LADY No wonder the First Lady fell for him. I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before the President, when she was still singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry Helmsley. SALLY I know, she was amazing. EXT. FRONT LAWN/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT The President walks up to the Red Cross tents placed on the front lawn. He stops one of the Red Cross volunteers. PRESIDENT WILSON Who can help me with missing persons? Without looking up, the young guy responds. RED CROSS VOLUNTEER Sorry man, I'm busy right now. He then recognizes who he's talking to. RED CROSS VOLUNTEER (CONT'D) I mean, of course sir. I didn't realize... What can I do for you, Mr. President? The President pats him on the shoulder. (CONTINUED) 75. PRESIDENT WILSON Don't worry about it. You're doing a great job son... A deep, low rumble begins, stopping everybody in place. As it builds, the President grabs onto a tent pole to secure himself. He looks out over Washington D.C. His eyes grow wide... The National Mall bends like rubber. The towering Washington Monument breaks into pieces. An even more deafening sound makes him turn-- The Capitol Building rises from behind the trees, lifted up by earth's incredible force. As the whole building breaks apart, the President is thrown to the ground. CUT TO: INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY All the officers and scientists are glued to monitors that show satellite images from all over the globe. Adrian and Prof. West stare in disbelief. SCIENCE OFFICER The capitol was hit by a 9.4. Laura enters the command center unnoticed. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER We lost communication with the White House, sir. She stands there frozen, emotionless. She looks over to Anheuser, who is shouting orders. Another officer hands him a phone. LIEUTENANT #2 President Makarenko for you sir. He's just entered Chinese air space. Anheuser takes the phone and after a beat answers. ANHEUSER That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command. Adrian and Laura look to each other baffled. (CONTINUED) 76. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) ... It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action... CUT TO: EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN Pope Benedict XVI holds mass in St. Peter's Basilica. Millions of followers flood Vatican City. It's a sea of candles. Amidst the mass of believers we see the Italian Prime Minister Antonioni with his family clinging to him. They all are praying. A low RUMBLE. People look around frightened. In the distance we hear SCREAMING. INT. SISTINE CHAPEL/CEILING - DAWN A few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under Michelangelo's famous fresco. Most prominent above them is `The Creation of Adam'. The cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies. A crack forms on the ceiling, shooting straight through God touching the finger of Adam. Then the whole fresco breaks apart. EXT. ST. PETER'S SQUARE/ROME - DAWN The people in St. Peter's square begin to panic-- The entire Vatican is lifted up in the air. We hold on the Prime Minister and his family, as the basilica collapses onto the fleeing masses. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNT CORCOVADO/RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY The giant statue of `Christ the Redeemer' on Mount Corcovado. Behind it, we see Rio de Janeiro being obliterated by violent quakes. (CONTINUED) 77. The famous statue of Jesus Christ begins to topple over and crashes down the mountain. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS/TIBET - NIGHT Neng Pang, the young Tibetan monk drives his truck up a bumpy mountain pass. His parents huddle in the back of the pick-up. The steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he slides the clutch and downshifts. As the vehicle slows on the steep incline, the vibrations become much worse. Neng worries that the truck may be breaking down. He pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise the steering wheel continues to vibrate. Looking out the windshield, he sees the whole earth shaking violently. NENG (in Chinese) Hold on back there! Rocks fall all around them. CUT TO: INT. THE ANTONOV - NIGHT Jackson sits inside one of the luxury cars and tries the radio. Kate opens the passenger door and gets in. JACKSON Couldn't sleep huh? Me neither. KATE Anything? JACKSON Nothing, just static. Not even an emergency signal. KATE I can't think about what's going on down there. Jackson switches off the radio. KATE (CONT'D) I wanted to thank you. For coming back for us. (CONTINUED) 78. JACKSON I couldn't have left you... Silence. They both look out through the front windshield at Lilly and Noah curled up together. KATE Do you think people change? JACKSON By `people' are we talking about me? KATE Do you think you've changed since we separated? JACKSON Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal now... KATE You know, you always had tunnel vision. You could always just block things out and write. You blocked all of us out Jackson. He thinks about this and can't help asking. JACKSON Do you love him? Gordon... KATE I love him enough. Kate gets out of the car and shuts the door. He watches her go. CUT TO: INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY The computers buzz with the incoming data. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER ... Cho Ming reports the first tremors, however none higher than 5.0. Anheuser looks relieved. Then the big news hits. SCIENCE OFFICER #1 The crust has begun to shift, Prof. West. PROF. WEST By what degree? (CONTINUED) 79. SCIENCE OFFICER #1 1.2 percent, but still moving. ANHEUSER Any clue what to expect next, Professor? PROF. WEST Once the movement of our land masses comes to a halt, we expect the formation of tidal waves, sir... proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding quakes. Adrian looks distressed as he turns to one of the officers. ADRIAN Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard? Laura notices Adrian's concern. SCIENCE OFFICER #2 We've recorded two quakes averaging 8.3. She grabs Adrian's hand. Anheuser sees this and his suspicions about them are confirmed. A cold little smile appears on his face. CUT TO: INT. SALON/CRUISE SHIP - NIGHT Tony is watching TV with a group of passengers. Harry has just entered and stands near the back of the room. A TEENAGE BOY with bad acne searches for an available channel that is still broadcasting. He finds a news program with lousy reception. NEWSCASTER ... Tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit... Unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of Japan is below water... The signal gets weaker. Harry watches Tony slowly stand up. As he turns to his friend, his knees begin to buckle. His face is pale. TONY I called... But I never got through. (CONTINUED) 80. HARRY I'm so sorry. Tony only stares back at him. Behind them, the TV rolls to the side, as the whole room begins to tilt. Harry grabs on to the door frame, as the passengers along with Tony fall like dominoes. HARRY (CONT'D) Tony!! As the ship rolls to the side, Harry finds himself hanging from the door frame now 20 feet off the ground. He's barely able to pull himself up and roll onto the middle deck. EXT. MIDDLE DECK/CRUISE SHIP - NIGHT On his back, Harry is shocked to see the star field and the moon shifting across the sky. An eerie sound fills the air. A gigantic swell has formed off to his right. It's a mountain of water. Harry turns to see another gargantuan swell close in from the other side of the `Freedom of the Seas'. CUT TO: EXT. SHIBAM/YEMEN - DAY The old walled city of Shibam is in ruins. The 2,000-year-old towers lie on the desert ground. Hundreds of believers have gathered to pray towards Mecca. As they raise their hands to heaven in unison, they slow their motion and the chanting dissipates. They stare into the distance not knowing if what they see is reality or only a mirage. A monstrous tidal wave rises from the desert sands thundering towards them. CUT TO: EXT. WHITE HOUSE/WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT President Wilson's body lays between the rubble. As he slowly regains consciousness, all he can hear is the flapping sound of the collapsed Red Cross tents. (CONTINUED) 81. As President Wilson gets to his feet, he sees-- A tidal wave come sweeping over the remains of the Washington Mall and it carries with it the battleships of the 14th Fleet of the US Navy that were anchored in Chesapeake Bay. The President looks ahead, calm and peaceful. PRESIDENT WILSON I'm coming home Dorothy... The CAMERA follows the aircraft carrier `USS John F. Kennedy' as it slams broadside into the White House. CUT TO: INT. COMMAND CENTER/AIR FORCE ONE - DAY Hushed voices. Anheuser, Adrian and Prof. West stand amongst a group of officers and analysts. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #1 All global ground communication has ceased sir. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER #2 The only signal our satellites are picking up are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming. ANHEUSER At least some good news. Anheuser turns to Adrian. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment? ADRIAN We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours. He nods to one of the analysts, who types in a couple of commands. ADRIAN (CONT'D) ... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation. (CONTINUED) 82. Everybody stares as the graphic illustrates what happened to planet Earth. ADRIAN (CONT'D) Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields... (POINTING) ... These are their new positions. Anheuser looks at the monitor, then turns to Adrian. ANHEUSER So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin? Silence. Adrian clears his throat. ADRIAN It's the south pole, sir. An ALARM SIGNAL goes off-- CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN A red light blinks on the plane's instrument panel. YURI (O.S.) What's that? SASHA Engine failure. GOVNO! Two of six are down. We must get ready. Yuri and Jackson are standing behind the pilots. JACKSON Let's go wake up the kids. Yuri nods and they make their way back to the lower deck. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN Jackson's family are all asleep in their seats, Lilly in her mom's lap. She looks like a little angel. Jackson can't bear to wake them. He caresses Lilly's face. NOAH (O.S.) Why do you hate Gordon? Jackson turns to see Noah is awake. (CONTINUED) 83. JACKSON What are you talking about? I don't hate Gordon. NOAH But you don't like him either. JACKSON I don't know him that well. NOAH But I know him. He's really nice. You should talk to him more often. You guys would get along really well. This breaks Jackson's heart. He pulls Noah tightly to his chest. JACKSON I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise. Kate opens her eyes. KATE Is it time? Jackson nods. KATE (CONT'D) Wake up Lil'bee. We're getting ready to land. On the opposite side of the aircraft, Yuri and Tamara help the twins get into their life vests. Noah is suspicious. NOAH What's wrong? Jackson looks at his kids. They both look scared. JACKSON Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy... and wet. The Antonov jerks to the side. Two more engines out. Alarm signals flash. EXT. ANTONOV - DAWN The remaining two engines barely hold the plane in the air as it dives into the clouds. 84. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN Jackson and his family huddle together. He puts his arms around Lilly and Noah. JACKSON Your daddy has to tell you something. In the background, Gordon climbs down from the cockpit. He is about to speak when he hears Jackson's voice. JACKSON (CONT'D) I know that with my writing and work I didn't have a lot of time for you both... Jackson glances at Kate. JACKSON (CONT'D) I wasn't there for you, the way I should have been. Jackson looks Kate directly in the eyes. JACKSON (CONT'D) ... And I am so very sorry for that. Gordon watches as Kate pulls the kids and Jackson tight. For the first time, they seem a little like the family they once were. GORDON (O.S.) Jackson, Yuri... I think you guys should come back up here. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN First Jackson and then Yuri enter the cockpit. Sasha points out of the window. SASHA Don't ask me how that happened. Behind them Yuri and Jackson stare at the snow covered mountains of the Himalayas. SASHA (CONT'D) There's no more ocean, and it looks like we're pretty close to where we wanted to go. GORDON It's as if the whole earth shifted by 1500 miles... (CONTINUED) 85. JACKSON No shit. (BEAT) It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement' Gordon... Prof. Hapgood, 1958. Jackson brims with joy. JACKSON (CONT'D) Way to go Charlie! A JOLT! SASHA We lost our last two engines. The plane drops rapidly, nearly scraping the tip of a mountain. Sasha and Gordon are doing all they can to keep the Antonov in the air. A vast glacier spreads out in front of them. SASHA (CONT'D) I'll shoot for that glacier. Drain the brake fluids. It's going to get rocky... There, the blue levers! The plane plummets, loosing altitude fast. SASHA (CONT'D) Listen up guys! This may sound a little crazy, but here's what you got to do... INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN Jackson and Yuri come running. Yuri yells at his boys. YURI (in Russian) Get up! Follow me! TAMARA Yuri bear, what are we doing? YURI We're taking the Bentley! INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN Sasha is struggling with the gyrating wheel. The glittering snow field comes flying towards them. (CONTINUED) 86. SASHA CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast! Sasha pulls the Antonov back up. SASHA (CONT'D) Now! Open it! Gordon yanks with all his might. A loud NOISE. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN The cargo door drops open. The Antonov is extremely close to the glacier's surface. Jackson tries to start the Bentley, but nothing happens. Everyone screams in panic. YURI SHUT UP EVERY ONE! They all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from Caesar. Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and clearly. YURI (CONT'D) Engine... start... The motor revs to life. Yuri looks at Jackson. YURI (CONT'D) Voice control... Sold me on it. INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN Sasha barely holds on. He yells at Gordon. SASHA Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down! GORDON What about you?! SASHA I'll be fine! I have to land this thing! Gordon hesitates. SASHA (CONT'D) What are you waiting for! (CONTINUED) 87. Sasha nods at him reassuringly. Gordon bolts out. INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN The cargo door scrapes against the glacier, hurling ice everywhere. The Bentley roars. YURI (O.S.) Push it Curtis! JACKSON We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon. Noah turns and sees Gordon. NOAH Tamara! Open the door! Gordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation. TAMARA Where's Sasha? GORDON He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down. Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as much speed as possible to soften their landing. LILLY Daaadddy! The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers. The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in opposite directions. The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and causing the aircraft to break apart. Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the deep. The plane crashes and explodes. 88. EXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow. The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking. JACKSON (O.S.) Everybody okay back there? KATE (O.S.) We're all fine. The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES. One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a surreal sight-- Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the mountain pass. GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from these flying machines. One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet and lands near the Bentley. Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a sharp tone. CHINESE COMMANDER Welcome to the People's Republic of China. Jackson nods to them. JACKSON Thank you... (to Lilly and Noah) Say thank you, kids. The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello... CHINESE COMMANDER What color are your passes? Jackson stands dumbfounded. The Commander repeats. CHINESE COMMANDER (CONT'D) What color are your boarding passes? Still no answer. He yells an order. The soldiers point their guns at them. (CONTINUED) 89. YURI (O.S.) I have green card. Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green plastic cards. YURI (CONT'D) For my boys and me. Tamara can't believe what she's hearing. TAMARA It's a joke... a mistake... (LAUGHING) Right Yuri? Yuri shrugs. Tamara lunges at him. TAMARA (CONT'D) (in Russian) You disgust me. You pig. Yuri brushes her off, coldly. And then speaks so they can all understand him. YURI You think I did not know about you and Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's soul. With that Yuri turns to the others. YURI (CONT'D) I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson remember, if someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first. Come boys! The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter. The dog barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara. The next moment, the helicopter takes off. GORDON What!... Did that just happen!? They're stranded. CUT TO: EXT. AIRFIELD IN CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN Air Force One is in the background as Laura, Anheuser, and other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of waiting helicopters. (CONTINUED) 90. Adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack. A Chinese Officer with a list shouts over the noise. CHINESE OFFICER (POINTING) Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr. Wilson the same. Laura and Anheuser reach the chopper. An authoritative Naval Officer greets them, and raises his voice. CAPTAIN MICHAELS I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the skipper of the American boat sir. After you! Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper. Captain Michaels helps Laura in. Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door slides shut and it lifts off. INT. HELICOPTER/CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN Laura catches Adrian's look of unease before they soar away. CAPTAIN MICHAELS My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson, for your father... Laura's look thanks him for this. He turns to Anheuser. CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D) Your party is the last to arrive. ANHEUSER I've been told of damages? CAPTAIN MICHAELS We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted. Captain Michaels looks up and points into the distance. CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D) There it is! EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN The CAMERA follows the choppers revealing-- Nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories, built into the face of a mountain. (CONTINUED) 91. In front of every gate there is a line of huge `Y' shaped metal support structures, which are the launching towers for the ships. They are each at least 800 feet high. It's an unparalleled feat of engineering. EXT. CHOPPER/CHO MING VALLEY - DAWN The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting. The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out. Laura follows. She looks around in awe. Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are immense. The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain. In the BACKGROUND we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with military personnel, waving his tickets. YURI What do mean we can't board Number 4? I want to speak to your supervisor. SOLDIER I am the supervisor! Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements. YURI I want your name! SOLDIER (pointing to his BADGE) Can you read? Now get the hell back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained. The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar. They look afraid. CUT TO: EXT. THE GLACIER/CHO MING - DAWN Jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape. They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a scree field. It is hard going. Jackson carries Lilly. JACKSON Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great. (CONTINUED) 92. Kate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind. She's still very upset. TAMARA I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it. GORDON Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments? TAMARA Cheap bastard. GORDON You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true? Tamara nods silently. TAMARA Now that he's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri. Suddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine. JACKSON You guys hear that? In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it. EXT. DIRT ROAD/NEAR CHO MING - DAWN Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of dust just as Jackson reaches the road. JACKSON (out of breath) Hey! Help! Wait for us! But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson, pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road. JACKSON (CONT'D) Shit! Shit! Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck, turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of the cabin. Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't believe his luck. (CONTINUED) 93. The others show up and they all run towards the truck. CUT TO: INT. INSIDE MOUNTAIN/CHO MING - DAWN Anheuser and Laura follow Captain Michaels and a Chinese Steward over one of the many boarding bridges erected inside the cavernous mountain that lead to one of the monstrous arks. Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe-- Deep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the ship, readying it for launch. Laura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the SHEIK we met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his huge family. Laura points down at the workers. LAURA Captain Michaels? What happens to all those people? The Captain doesn't know what to say. Anheuser turns. ANHEUSER Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest. Laura hates him in that moment. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Captain? Where is the Bridge? Anheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals we saw being airlifted over the mountains. CHINESE STEWARD (O.S.) Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way. Laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward. CUT TO: EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE Thousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from destroyed cities in the distance. (CONTINUED) 94. Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's family trails behind. Distant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from the cities below. People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a number on its speed dial. INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE Adrian is unpacking. He lays down his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings. ADRIAN Satnam? (CONFUSED) Where are you? SATNAM (O.S.) On the Nampan Plateau... Adrian's face goes pale. ADRIAN What?! SATNAM There's a tidal wave coming from the East! It's huge! ADRIAN Satnam, what happened? SATNAM (O.S.) We never got picked up, Adrian, the airlift never came! Adrian closes his eyes. EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE Satnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley. SATNAM I have to go! A wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards him. A tidal wave of gigantic height. Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance. (CONTINUED) 95. He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child. INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE Adrian hears SCREAMING on the phone and the deafening sound of the approaching wave. He tenses up, desperate but unable to do anything. As the noise reaches its height, the line goes dead. Adrian is left breathless. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE Adrian storms onto the bridge. Many officers and analysts are at work under Captain Michaels. ADRIAN Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India? SCIENCE OFFICER One moment, sir. Anheuser and Prof. West step over and join him. ANHEUSER Helmsley, what's going on here? ADRIAN Looks like our model was wrong. They all stare at the monitor showing several tidal waves coming in from the south. ADRIAN (CONT'D) Satnam was talking about a wave from the East. A science officer selects a different quadrant on the satellite display. They all stare at the new tidal wave that's coming from the East of the Cho Ming valley. PROF. WEST Jesus! Anheuser is shocked. ANHEUSER What does this mean? (CONTINUED) 96. ADRIAN The flooding will happen earlier. Bobby, can you plug in the new data please? As the officer does this, Prof. West looks at Adrian with questioning eyes. ADRIAN (CONT'D) Satnam didn't get picked up. Prof. West is horrified. SCIENCE OFFICER (O.S.) Ready sir. Adrian turns back to the monitor and sees the new tidal wave that is coming towards the Cho Ming valley. ADRIAN This one is at least 1500 meters high! ANHEUSER Talk to me Helmsley. What does this mean for us? ADRIAN Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down? Every one on the bridge stares at a display. It reads-- 02hrs - 09min - 07sec The science officer nervously hits a few keys and the display changes to-- 00hrs - 28min - 10sec... and counting. We see the shock on Anheuser's face. ANHEUSER Get me the other Heads of State. CUT TO: EXT. GATE/CHO MING SITE - EARLY MORNING Neng's truck, loaded with Jackson and the others, creeps up to the service entrance of the launch site. A lone figure awaits them. This is Neng's older brother Lin, who we saw signing up for the 'Chinese Dam Project'. Lin notices the strangers in the pick-up truck. (CONTINUED) 97. LIN (in Chinese) Who are they? Neng answers hesitantly. NENG We found them by the side of the road, my brother. LIN You must send them back. NENG I am a follower of the great Lama Yak La. You know I cannot do that. The others watch the interaction but do not understand. Jackson senses a problem. He grabs Lilly and Noah. JACKSON Come with daddy. Gordon and Tamara stare perplexed as Jackson approaches Lin with his kids. JACKSON (CONT'D) At least take our children with you. Please. Lin answers in broken English. LIN Why should I do that? JACKSON For the same reason you sent for your parents. Lin stares at him stone faced. In desperation, Kate turns to Mrs. Pang. KATE I have no clue if you understand what I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother, please take my kids with you! Silence. A beat. The old Chinese lady turns to Lin. MRS. PANG (in Chinese) We are all children of this earth. LIN My plan will not work for so many, mother. (CONTINUED) 98. She looks up at her son, determined. MRS. PANG We will take them all. Bata? Mr. Pang nods and reluctantly, Lin motions to Jackson to follow. Kate bows to Mrs. Pang. KATE Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much. Jackson and the others acknowledge what Kate has done. CUT TO: INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING We finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains. Nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other. Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the Seas'. However, they look more like spaceships than anything, having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force of nature. But only three of these monstrous ARKS are complete. Number 4 is being repaired, all the others are still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding. Suddenly SIRENS goes off! The boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to retract. There's growing confusion among the thousands of workers and security personnel. INT. PLATFORM, SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING Opposite the boarding bridges, on a large platform, Yuri and his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers. They watch as massive stern gates begin to close. Yuri jumps up and yells to the others. YURI They're leaving without us! The soldier from earlier points his gun at him. SOLDIER What did I tell you! Caesar barks at the guy. (CONTINUED) 99. YURI (POINTING) Look! Idiot! They are leaving you behind too! The soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out. He grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates. All the other passengers surge forward with him. In the distance, on the bow side of the ships, the huge mountain gates of the bay open, revealing a stunning view of Cho Ming Valley. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE/CHO MING - MORNING Lin leads his group over a ridge. In front of their eyes-- The gates to the mountain open! LIN (in Chinese) We have to hurry! (to Jackson) They launch! We run out of time! They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the many Y-shaped launch structures towering in front of the gates. Neng and Kate help Mr. and Mrs. Pang down the rocky terrain. INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - MORNING A screeching and thundering noise! THE THREE COMPLETED VESSELS BEGIN TO INCH FORWARD on metal girders connecting the Y-shaped launch towers. INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING Laura feels a jolt. She rushes out of her small cabin and into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless corridor. She struggles to fight her way through. A digital voice blares over the speakers. COMPUTER VOICE Countdown to departure. Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds. Laura bumps into one of Adrian's Science Officers. (CONTINUED) 100. LAURA Where can I find Adrian Helmsley? SCIENCE OFFICER He's in the Technical Command Centre. Follow me. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - MORNING The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the open. Support helicopters swarm around them like flies. EXT. BENEATH A LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO-MING - MORNING Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal ladders of one of the launch towers. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING Verbal commands fly back and forth. Anheuser watches the preparations from a large window. He looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as they continue to be pulled into place. INT. COMMAND BRIDGES/OTHER SHIPS - MORNING We cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command posts. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING A hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the first to climb out. Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made behemoth. Lin hastily pulls the others up. LIN (in Chinese) Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give me your hand. It's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson hurries to pull up the rest of the group. Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship. (CONTINUED) 101. JACKSON Move Lil'bee! Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are already huddled on a small platform. As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both see this, but Jackson is closer-- He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to his death. For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod. EXT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The three completed ships are half way out, grinding to their final launching position. A mob of passengers led by Yuri has fought their way to the ship. More and more people join them, including soldiers. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING Lin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform. The sound of SCREAMING PEOPLE makes them turn. The storming masses have arrived at the access platform. There is now a huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships. TAMARA (POINTING) Oh my god, that's Yuri! Next to Yuri are his twins, holding Caesar. She yells! TAMARA (CONT'D) Caesar! EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms, leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the platform with the launching towers. Alec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs them by their necks. YURI Let that stupid dog go! (CONTINUED) 102. He's panicked. The arriving masses are pushing them to the drop off at the edge of the platform. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING The ship has reached its targeted position. A small hatch lines up directly in front of Lin and his group. LIN (in Chinese) Okay. Now! One by one they all climb into the hatch. Jackson being the last in, notices that Tamara has stayed back. JACKSON Tamara! Come on! Get in! She doesn't move, anxiously waiting for her beloved dog darting towards her. EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The mob pushes at Yuri and his boys. Passengers on either side tumble off the platform. Yuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a tiny ledge 8 feet below. To his right, he sees a small ladder leading down. YURI (in Russian) Down there! Oleg, you go first! As they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the deep. Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running towards Tamara. OLEG Daddy look, Tamara! Yuri cannot believe his eyes. EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING SITE - MORNING The hatch behind Tamara begins to move. The hydraulic supports are being lifted, sealing up the vessel. TAMARA Caesar darling! Jackson reaches out from the closing hatch. (CONTINUED) 103. JACKSON Tamara! Get in! Tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns. TAMARA Come to mommy! Caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch seals. As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives Yuri the finger. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING Lin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the hydraulics for the tail gate are located. He opens a tool cabinet, retrieving a giant electrical power drill, almost too big to be carried by one person. Lin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew the huge bolts. He looks at Jackson. LIN I need your help. INT. TECHNICAL COMMAND CENTER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Laura and the Science Officer enter the Technical Command Center. She finds Adrian staring at a wall of monitors showing the horrifying scenario on the platforms. People are falling to their deaths in large numbers in their desperation to board the ship. LAURA What in god's name is happening Adrian? ADRIAN Anheuser convinced them all to launch. Outside, panicking workers, screaming for their life! Deserted passengers waving their green cards! Adrian makes a decision and rushes out. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser turns hearing Adrian storming onto the bridge. ADRIAN Anheuser! We have to stop this madness. (CONTINUED) 104. With that, Adrian turns to the Communication Officer. ADRIAN (CONT'D) Bobby, make sure the other bridges can hear this. The officer hesitates as Laura enters in the background. ANHEUSER What do you think you're doing? ADRIAN I know exactly what I'm doing. (To Bobby) Turn it on! Bobby flicks a switch. Adrian's voice echoes through all the ships. ADRIAN (CONT'D) This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson... INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY The German Chancellor turns to one of the technicians on the bridge of the European Ship. GERMAN CHANCELLOR Can you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann? Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers. ADRIAN (O.S.) I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization... INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser looks on stoney faced. ADRIAN ... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die? Laura watches him proudly. (CONTINUED) 105. ADRIAN (CONT'D) A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive. (PAUSE) Or at least I don't want to be part of it. Anheuser cuts in with sarcasm. ANHEUSER We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off. The Communications Officer looks at Adrian. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) That's an order soldier. ADRIAN Don't do it! INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY The Russian President, together with the heads of state from China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds. ADRIAN (O.S.) We have to open our gates and let these people in. All of them. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser has had enough. ANHEUSER Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow. He's almost screaming now. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian?! Silence. Adrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and instead speaks softly now. (CONTINUED) 106. ADRIAN There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives. All eyes are glued to Adrian. ADRIAN (CONT'D) I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why? Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues. ADRIAN (CONT'D) He died because we forgot to pick him up. (PAUSE) I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children? Silence. Laura steps up alongside Adrian. LAURA If my father were here, he would open the gates. Adrian and Laura share a look. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (O.S.) The people of Russia along with... INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY His Asian colleagues nod in approval. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ... China and Japan agree to open the gates. INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY The German Chancellor speaks up. GERMAN CHANCELLOR The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister... 107. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY GERMAN CHANCELLOR (O.S.) ... We vote to open the gates. Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat. Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief. Adrian turns to the Captain. ADRIAN Captain Michaels, you heard them. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships begin to creek open. The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly! INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Lilly crawls through the CONNECTING TUNNEL meeting up with Kate in a large bay on the other side. LILLY Phew... It stinks in here. Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in DISBELIEF-- A Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them. Caesar barks at her. TAMARA Sssh...Caesar. A second later, hundreds of different ANIMALS RESPOND. They are in the zoological bay. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Gordon helps Noah up the small ladder leading to the connecting tunnel. Just as he goes to hand him Jackson's backpack, the HYDRAULIC MOTORS begin to GROWL! Lin looks up in panic. He screams. LIN They're opening the gate! It will crush us! The whole ceiling begins to lower towards them. From down below, Jackson sees his son about to be hit by it. (CONTINUED) 108. JACKSON Noah! Watch out! Gordon makes a split second decision. With all his strength, he shoves the boy into the tunnel. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY From the other side of the tunnel, Kate watches as the metal ceiling misses Noah by a hair, but catches Gordon, wiping him off the ladder. KATE No! INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson watches helplessly as Gordon falls past him. He survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the sloping surface, but he can't. He slips. Gordon is crushed between the gears, sharing his last look with Jackson before he dies. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate helps a trembling Noah out of the tunnel. NOAH Something happened, mom. Kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly. She fights back the tears. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson and Lin know they're running out of time, their remaining space is shrinking every second. JACKSON We have to stop it! Lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall. As it digs deeper into the metal, the hydraulic starts to slow down. 109. EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING - DAY Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge boarding gate lowers towards them. They are trapped. Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be crushed. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Back in the chamber, Lin still struggles with the drill. Suddenly he slips. Jackson manages to catch his fall. But in the process Lin's foot gets caught between the gears, mangling it. He screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a halt. JACKSON You did it, man. You did it. In great pain, Lin grins back at him. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a thundering noise. People begin to rush on board. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Alarm signals go off. The Captain turns to one of his officers. CAPTAIN MICHAELS What's wrong with the gate? OFFICER I don't know. Maybe there's something jamming it, sir. The countdown on the monitor reads 2 min. 40 sec. Laura and Adrian share a worried look. We hear a HOLLOW BELL ring! CUT TO: EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY Lama Yak La rings the large bronze bell of his monastery. (CONTINUED) 110. The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley. As a gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up-- A tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains. The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is wiped clean from the earth. CUT TO: INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The technicians desperately try to figure out what's wrong. An officer waves Adrian over. SURVEILLANCE OFFICER Sir, we have a breach in the zoological bay. ADRIAN Can you zoom in? The video camera moves in on Kate, Noah and Lilly. Adrian can't believe his eyes. He turns to Laura. ADRIAN (CONT'D) I know those kids. Remember the book I told you about? Their father wrote it. Captain Michaels shouts across the room. CAPTAIN MICHAELS We're loaded. We can close the gates sir. ANHEUSER Do it! Anheuser looks nervously at the countdown. It reads 1:34 EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access platform onto the stern gate of the American ship. Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing his chance and lifting the first of his boys up. YURI (in Russian) Pull yourself up! Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate. (CONTINUED) 111. Inside the ship, officers yell. DECK OFFICER (O.S.) To the lower decks people! The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close. Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot quite reach. Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding. YURI Oleg! Catch your brother! Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms. Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until he hits the rocks beneath. Oleg pulls his brother from above. INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY A SIREN blasts. Both of Yuri's sons are now on deck. A loading officer pulls them back, away from the gate. DECK OFFICER Boys, you gotta move. ALEC We wait for our father! He's still down there! The loading officer attempts to comfort them. DECK OFFICER There's no one down there. (GENTLE) Come on boys, come... The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt. The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY ALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors. ANHEUSER Why is the stern gate not closing? (CONTINUED) 112. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir. ADRIAN (O.S.) Captain, over here. They race over. Adrian points to a monitor. ADRIAN (CONT'D) I think we found the problem. On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately waiting for Jackson and Lin. ADRIAN (CONT'D) How did they get in there? SURVEILLANCE OFFICER They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There... Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling along a wounded Lin. LAURA That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong. ANHEUSER You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean... Adrian tries to ignore this. ADRIAN Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber. Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura. ANHEUSER You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter? Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in the face. He drops to the floor, out cold. Everyone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian looks around. (CONTINUED) 113. ADRIAN What are you all waiting for? They speed off. The countdown reads 0 min. 53 sec. CUT TO: EXT. AIRFIELD/TIBET - DAY Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming force. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However, the props of the American ship don't move. In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering towards them. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY An IMPACT WARNING sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew. One of the officers explains. TECHNICAL OFFICER If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start. ADRIAN There's no way to override it? TECHNICAL OFFICER No sir, it has to be done manually. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate, Noah and Lilly watch as Jackson nears the end of the tunnel with Lin. Neng comforts his brother who's about to pass out. NENG (in Chinese) Almost there, Lin... CUT TO: 114. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY THE WAVE FINALLY HITS! All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water. They rock back and forth. Only the huge support towers they're resting on, keep them anchored. INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY A new ALARM sounds as water begins to shoot through the open stern gate of the American ship. The people on the loading bay panic, among them we see Alec and Oleg. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The same ALARM rings out in the hallways of the ship. Laura, Adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor, as the vessel undulates back and forth. SURVEILLANCE OFFICER Water has penetrated the stern! Laura looks unsure. LAURA What now? SURVEILLANCE OFFICER The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time. Adrian looks at him. ADRIAN Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber? SURVEILLANCE OFFICER If we don't hurry, we won't be able to. Despite the violent movement of the ship, Adrian pushes on down the corridor towards the back of the boat. They follow. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Water is also now rushing into the Zoological Bay and only the giraffe can manage to keep her head dry. Jackson is not yet out of the tunnel with an unconscious Lin. (CONTINUED) 115. Kate shouts across to Tamara. KATE Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah. Kate reaches in to help Jackson as Tamara begins to move with Lilly. Noah remains back with his mother. Jackson finally makes it through with Lin. Kate is almost tearful with relief to see him. KATE (CONT'D) I was so worried about you. Suddenly the Zoological bay begins to seal itself off. Lilly, already in the next compartment with Tamara and her dog, screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up, from the floor to the ceiling. It separates Lilly from her family. LILLY Mummy! Jackson and Kate turn but it's too late. They only catch a glimpse of Lilly before they are sealed in. The water level continues to rise. INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around. Down the corridor, in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew approaching. But between them she spots the next chamber door rising quickly. TAMARA Lilly run! Lilly starts moving as Tamara turns and picks up Caesar. Moving quickly, Lilly is able to climb up and over the fast rising door. But as she dangles from the other side, she looks down and is too scared to jump. TAMARA (O.S) (CONT'D) Lilly! Take him. Lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold Caesar above the quickly narrowing gap. In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he gets crushed and together they fall to the ground. (CONTINUED) 116. Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks around. She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in. INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY Laura picks Lilly up and comforts her. Adrian realizes they are too late. He turns to the rescue crew. ADRIAN Is there any way to talk to them? Lilly is close to tears. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The water continues to flood in as Jackson helps Neng with his unconscious brother. JACKSON We have to move him higher. (looks around) Over there! Suddenly, a VIOLENT SHAKE throws them all off balance, pitching them into the water. EXT. LAUNCH PILLAR/UNDER WATER - DAY In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's launch towers. Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other launch towers follow like dominos. The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting sideways, rudderless. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Chaos. Fear. Everybody holds on for dear life. EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY The vessel is swept away, over the mountain ridge. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Alec and Oleg scream, desperately trying to hold on as the whole ship capsizes. 117. EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY The giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed around by the debris and raging waters. But then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up and seems to steady itself. However, the strong currents continue to force it through the mountain ranges of the Himalayas. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The officers try to regain some control. NAVAL OFFICER Moving at 34 knots, sir. CAPTAIN MICHAELS What is our position? NAVIGATION OFFICER Darjeeling valley, heading south east, sir. The Captain's face drops. CAPTAIN MICHAELS You must be kidding! INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The water rises fast as Kate sees the severity of Lin's wound for the first time. KATE We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die. A split second later Noah holds out his belt. NOAH Mum, will this do? Suddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker. ADRIAN (Over a speaker) Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We met once before. Your daughter is with me. Kate screams with relief. (CONTINUED) 118. KATE Lilly! INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY Adrian is using an emergency wall intercom, with Laura next to him, holding Lilly. LILLY I'm alright Mom! Caesar barks. INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Tamara hears Caesar over the speaker in her compartment and smiles with relief. She is struggling to stay afloat though, and is running out of air. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson discovers the wall speaker. He moves closer to it. ADRIAN (O.S.) We can't get to you. Whatever you did, jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get it out... None of us will make it. INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY All eyes are on Adrian as he speaks. ADRIAN You're our only hope. Adrian looks at Laura. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY JACKSON I'll go back. I'll try my best. NOAH I'll go with you. JACKSON You stay with Mommy. Jackson looks at Kate. (CONTINUED) 119. JACKSON (CONT'D) I'll be right back... The water is up to their chest now. Jackson takes a breath and disappears underwater. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Back on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets to his feet. His nose is bleeding. He looks around him. ANHEUSER Captain, what's happening? The Captain looks at him annoyed. CAPTAIN MICHAELS What's happening?... (PAUSES) We're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser. Anheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the window and sees the massive rock face of Mount Everest in the distance. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson swims down into the dark chamber and reaches the jammed power tool, pulling at it. But it doesn't budge. INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The water level in Tamara's compartment is at its height now and she goes under. She struggles below the surface for a moment, looking around desperately for a way out but there is none. Tamara drowns. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson manages to find an air pocket. He fills up his lungs with air and thinks hard. As he strips off his jacket, he seems to have a plan. He dives under again. 120. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents. Kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls it tight. Lin screams. Noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed, to go and help his father. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet. Jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. He begins to use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Anheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face of Mount Everest is almost upon them. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of air now, but despite this, Kate still tends to Lin. After a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified to see that Noah is nowhere to be found. KATE Noah! INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift the drill. To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping. Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to loosen it before finally the drill comes free. Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he spots the knapsack containing his laptop. He dives back down for it. 121. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Noah emerges from the water. NOAH Mom, we did it! Kate pulls him to her, relieved he is safe. Noah smiles and calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker. INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY Lilly and Laura wait nervously. They hear a muffled voice. NOAH (O.S.) We got it free. Can you hear me? We did it! Adrian leaps up when he hears this. He flicks a button on the intercom. ADRIAN Captain Michaels - close the gate! INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Hearing this, the Captain yells the eagerly awaited order. CAPTAIN MICHAELS That's affirmative. Close the gate! TECHNICAL OFFICER Ay, ay, Sir. EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYAS - DAY We hear a BOOMING sound as the tail gate finally seals. INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson reaches his knapsack, but when sees Noah's cell phone lying next to it, he makes a decision and reaches for that instead. He hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles. But as he turns to swim back, his face freezes-- He's looking into the lifeless eyes of Gordon, who floats inches from his face. 122. EXT. PROPELLERS/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The gigantic propellers fight against the current, hitting rock at the base of the mountain. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY The battle seems hopeless. Captain Michaels yells at the top of his lungs. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Engage starboard stabilizers! OFFICERS One is engaged... two is engaged... number three is out, sir! The vessel scrapes against the rocks, throwing Anheuser to the floor. EXT. DARJEELING VALLEY/HIMALAYA - DAY The giant ship escapes the mountain with an inch to spare. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Everyone on the bridge watches in awe as Mount Everest, earth's highest peak, drifts slowly past. After a long beat, they begin to holler and cheer. INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Kate hears the CHEERING coming from the speakers. The water level stops rising but she still looks around in panic. KATE Noah! Where is he? Noah begins to cry. NOAH He was just behind me... Finally! Jackson bursts out of the water and takes a lungfull of wonderful air. Kate and Noah are overjoyed. The Pangs smile to one another. Jackson looks Kate squarely in the eyes. (CONTINUED) 123. JACKSON If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me. Kate embraces him tightly. KATE Whatever you do... I will never let you go again. Noah is all smiles. FADE TO BLACK 2013 We hear a voice. ADRIAN (O.S.) ... Day 988. No one is waiting for anything to happen... FADE UP The CAMERA moves over the last lines of Jackson's novel. INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian sits in his cabin, his copy of `Farewell Atlantis' in his lap. ADRIAN ... and all we can hear is the sound of our own breathing that reminds us we are still sharing our memories, hopes and ideas. Opposite him, Laura sits listening to him read. ADRIAN (CONT'D) ... And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin. (PAUSE) The end. Adrian closes the book. There's a moment of silence. LAURA How many copies did you say that sold? (CONTINUED) 124. ADRIAN Less than 500. (with a smile) It's what you might call a cult classic. Laura looks at him grinning. LAURA It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley? ADRIAN (PLAYFUL) Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements. LAURA Actually my diary's pretty open. The intimate moment is cut short. OFFICER (O.S.) (over loudspeaker) Mr. Helmsley to the bridge please. INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian and Laura make their way to the bridge. CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I will be giving the orders to unseal the decks. INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Jackson and his family stand amongst thousands of other people who are gathering in anticipation. CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.) Please be careful when you step out and of course... enjoy the fresh air. Jackson kneels down and zips up Lilly's jacket. She is holding Caesar, whose still wearing his diamond collar. LILLY Daddy? When can we go back home? (CONTINUED) 125. JACKSON There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's our home now. Don't be scared. LILLY I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups. JACKSON (PROUDLY) That's my big girl. Jackson squeezes Lilly's shoulder. OLEG (O.S.) Can we pet him? Lilly turns to see Yuri's boys standing next to her. LILLY Of course you can. He's your doggie. The boys both smile at her. INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian and Laura enter the bridge. ADRIAN You called for me, sir? CAPTAIN MICHAELS Prof. West has something to show you, Mr. Helmsley. The Captain directs him to a monitor. CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D) Looks like your scientific projections are way off again. The Captain grins at Prof. West. PROF. WEST The water is receding much faster than we projected, Adrian... A monitor reveals an image of the African continent, however its shape changed dramatically. The image of the southern tip is enlarged. LAURA What's that? (CONTINUED) 126. PROF. WEST It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world. It's now the Drakensberg mountains of Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely, never even flooded. CAPTAIN MICHAELS Our European colleagues have already set course for it. Captain Michaels hands Adrian a short wave radio. CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D) Here, somebody wants to talk to you. Adrian curious, grabs the mic. ADRIAN This is Helmsley. We hear a muffled, raspy voice through the speakers. INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY Harry Helmsley stands beside the cruise ship's Captain. VOICE No, this is Helmsley. ADRIAN (O.S.) Dad!... Is that you? INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian is ecstatic. Captain Michaels explains. CAPTAIN MICHAELS We should have a visual of the `Freedom of the Seas' shortly. ADRIAN Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up. How's Tony? INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY Harry looks over at Tony who's listening, smiling. HARRY HELMSLEY He's fine, son. We're all fine. (CONTINUED) 127. ADRIAN (O.S.) See you guys soon. Bye dad. Harry hangs up. He picks up Tony, embracing him wildly. INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY Adrian, still excited from speaking with his dad, grabs Laura and kisses her on the lips. She squeals. ANHEUSER (O.S.) Put that woman down Helmsley. Adrian looks at Anheuser, unsure of what he might say. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Young guys like you with your idealistic dreams, you think you can change the world... Adrian and Laura exchange a look. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) I just pray to God, that you keep on making the right calls... in this new world of ours. Adrian nods and with a smile to Laura turns to leave. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) Mr. Helmsley, one more thing. Adrian turns back. ANHEUSER (CONT'D) There was no one. ADRIAN Pardon me? ANHEUSER There was no white kid better than you. I'm terribly sorry I said that. Anheuser puts out his hand. Adrian takes it. INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.) This is your Captain speaking. Standby to open Deck 1. OFFICER Standing by Sir. (CONTINUED) 128. Neng pushes his brother Lin in a wheelchair onto the deck next to his parents. Mrs. Pang turns to her husband. MRS. PANG (in Chinese) I wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars? MR.PANG Do not fear. Some things will never change. The old Chinese man forces a little smile. Closer to the front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah. JACKSON I thought you might want this. He takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to him. NOAH Do you think I'll still get a signal ... Dad? Jackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and hugs him. Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them. ADRIAN I finally finished your book Jackson. KATE Really? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end. Jackson looks at her, smiling playfully. JACKSON Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think? Adrian smiles. ADRIAN I'd say... those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole. Suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a burst of pressurised air. A murmur goes through the crowd. Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to roll back and light streams in. (CONTINUED) 129. The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser looks hopeful. Jackson pulls his family close as the first rays of daylight hit their faces. EXT. AMERICAN SHIP/SOMEWHERE IN THE HIMALAYAS - DAY Hatches unseal all around the ship. Sun streams through the clouds. Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of day. A majestic moment. EXT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice- covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy. Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site-- The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak, surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most beautiful rainbow. This is the new world. And again we hear Mozart's Adagio... THE END\",\n",
       "       '30 MINUTES OR LESS Written by Michael Diliberti & Matthew Sullivan 12-11-09 The following is very loosely based on some shit that actually happened... OVER BLACK We hear the roar of a V8 engine, piped out through some throaty, fucked up muffler, as EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY An \\'89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway. It\\'s got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the EXT. SUBURBS - DAY The car fast approaches a stop sign, dangerously blows through the intersection. INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING We don\\'t see the DRIVER, only the redlining RPMs, Vans slip- ons working the pedals, wristwatch being checked. The wheel cranks right as the car turns onto a - One way street. A minivan flies right at us. The Mustang hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and - Garbage explodes like confetti. The wipers engage, brushing the trash aside. The car whips another turn and EXT. SUBURBS - DAY The Mustang fishtails around a corner and skids away. CUT TO: TIRES SCREECH Brake pads smoke. The Mustang stops outside EXT. HOUSE - DAY The Driver jumps out of the car. As he rushes to the front door, we see the urgent package he is delivering. TWO LARGE PIZZAS Before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15- YEAR-OLDS stare out. 15-YEAR-OLD That\\'s 34 minutes. You\\'re 4 minutes late. Pizza\\'s free. REVEAL our guy staring back at the kids. This is WILL (25), probably good looking in another life. 2. Right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red \"Giorgio\\'s Trattoria\" hat and a sweaty matching t-shirt. WILL Gimme a break. You guys live two towns away. It\\'s pretty much fucking impossible to get here in 30 minutes. OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD Exactly. That\\'s why we ordered from your shitty \"trattoria.\" WILL This is gonna come out of my paycheck. You sure you don\\'t want to take the moral high ground? OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD We\\'d rather take the pizzas. Will takes a calming breath. Hands over the pizzas. WILL Ok. You guys are pretty smart. You figured out a way to beat the system. (PEEKS INSIDE) Got the house to yourselves? 15-YEAR-OLD That\\'s right. WILL Not bad. Any jailbait in there? Little pizza and a rainbow party? The kids shakes their heads. WILL Seriously? Well, two hustlers like yourselves gotta have the place stocked with beer and whippits and shit, right? Just call the girls up and let them know the party\\'s on. 15-YEAR-OLD Man, we don\\'t have any of that stuff. Will makes a show of mulling this over. WILL I really shouldn\\'t do this...but you seem like a couple of good dudes. I\\'ll tell you what, you give me the money that your mom left you for the pizzas, and I\\'ll grab you some beers. (MORE) 3. WILL (CONT\\'D) (BEAT) But I get to keep the change as a tip. Deal? The kids look at each other. One hesitantly pulls out some cash. Will snatches it and heads off. WILL I\\'ll see you in like 20 minutes. The kids look uncertain. As if sensing this, Will stops before getting into his ride. WILL You boys like Budweiser, right? 15-YEAR-OLD Uh, yeah, totally. OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD Love that shit! INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING The sun sets. Will cruises back into his own middle-class town in suburban Maryland. A six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat. Will stops at a light. Checks out a PRETTY YOUNG THING in the Jeep beside him. She catches him looking, rolls her eyes. The light turns and the Jeep skids away. Will self consciously removes his \"Giorgio\\'s\" cap. INT. GIORGIO\\'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT Will enters and nods at CHRISTOPHER (40s), the manager. His balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a day\\'s worth of pizza grease. WILL Yo, Chris. Let me cash the fuck out. Will hands over some cash to Christopher. CHRISTOPHER You have a pretty good shift? WILL For sure. I mean, the part where I had to drop off all those pizzas kinda sucked, but the rest was cool. 4. CHRISTOPHER Oh, yeah? \\'Cause, I got some kids calling in saying you ripped them off. Promised to buy them beer or something. WILL I actually did buy the beer, but it would have been illegal to give it to them, right? So I\\'m gonna do the responsible thing and drink it myself. CHRISTOPHER That\\'s real funny. But I\\'m trying to run a business here. WILL What kind of business promises to deliver anywhere in 30 minutes? It\\'s ridiculous. CHRISTOPHER I don\\'t wanna hear another one of your bullshit excuses. You\\'re fired. WILL Come on. If I didn\\'t need this job, I wouldn\\'t be doing this shitty job. Chris is unmoving. WILL Fuck! Whatever! Will storms off. As he gets to the door - CHRISTOPHER You know, you were an okay driver half the time. And you\\'re not a Puerto Rican. Which means something to me. WILL That\\'s poignant. CHRISTOPHER I guess I could rehire you, on a provisional basis. Of course, this would be at the slightly reduced \"new company rate.\" WILL Are you fucking serious? CHRISTOPHER I don\\'t know. Is there anyone else left in town for you to work for? 5. Will shakes his head. Swallows what\\'s left of his pride. WILL When do I start? EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT Will sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer. He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare. The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection. He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming Outkast\\'s \"Ms. Jackson.\" He stops when he notices Will in the shadows. CHET What the hell? Have you just been sitting there? WILL Yep. Caught the whole show. Really classy move at the end. You know, the kiss. Putting your tongue in her mouth right after you fucked it. CHET Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure me on a weeknight, in her car no less...I\\'m not gonna make her feel like an untouchable. I\\'m gonna make her feel like a lady. WILL What manners. May I offer you some alcohol, sir. To wash the taste of yourself out of your mouth. Will offers his beer. Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect. CHET By the way, she said she had a friend. Maybe we can go on our first double date since you tried to talk Jackie Fortunato and her cousin into having a four-way with us. WILL I misread their body language. It happens. 6. Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him. WILL Come on. Let\\'s go inside, drink your beer and watch shit get crazy. (FANS MOVIES) Old favorites. You choose. Lethal Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2...was gonna get the third Lethal Weapon, but decided on a porn. So it\\'s really between the first two. CHET I choose sleep. I gotta teach a class at eight. WILL You\\'re a sub. Just call in sick. Like the real teacher did. CHET Come on, man, you know I got promoted to full-time last month. You bought me a laser pointer. Will heaves a sigh. WILL Yeah, I know. I guess I\\'m just having a hard time accepting you as \"the man.\" You know, flunking kids, giving out spite detentions to girls you wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit. CHET I also get healthcare and my summers off. It\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s a career. Will grudgingly stands up. WILL I guess that\\'s just the difference between you and me. He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs. WILL I\\'m like Riggs. Cruising the streets. No rules, no attachments. Every other day some asshole is trying to take my badge. You\\'re fucking Murtaugh. Always worried about your pension. Well, guess what, it gets old after the first movie. 7. CHET I just got head. I\\'m totally Riggs. Will shakes his head, turns and walks off. INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch. His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn. Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover - It\\'s full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays, a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young. Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at high school graduation, looking just as young. They have their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will and the girl look very high and very happy. Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM. WILL Fuck. INT. MUSTANG - DAY Will jumps in and starts the engine. As he tucks his \"Giorgio\\'s\" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in the rear-view mirror. WILL You asshole. You titanic asshole. Come on down and get your prize. He makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head...pulls the trigger and BOOM! WE\\'RE IN EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY A watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits. Loud, dumb laughter echoes. Standing 20 yards away is DWAYNE (32), an intense, meaty guy in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt. On his left bicep is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird. DWAYNE Fruit motherfuckin\\' salad! 8. Crouched beside him is JAY (27), tall and awkward, in a wool surplus cap. He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne. His eyes are magnified into saucers by his thick glasses. There\\'s a peculiar eagerness to please in them. JAY This one\\'s gonna blow even bigger. DWAYNE Boy, if you weren\\'t such a skinny little bitch you coulda been in the military or something. JAY Whatever. I don\\'t need the military. I taught myself how to do this shit. DWAYNE I hear that. I taught myself how to eat pussy. And cut my own hair. Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. He returns and pulls out a detonator. Dwayne snatches it. DWAYNE This one\\'s all me. (makes \"radio\" sounds) Mr. President, we have enemies at the gate. Give me the order. (more \"radio\" sounds) Fuck that, sir. I don\\'t negotiate with terrorists! Dwayne presses a button and BOOM! The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys\\' smiling faces with fruit juice. INT. KITCHEN, NICE HOUSE - DAY Large and early-90s chic. Dwayne and Jay have the fridge open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate. Dwayne is debating the amount of meat on the plate...adds some more. DWAYNE Wanna make sure I get enough calories. JAY I thought you wanted to get diesel for the summer. Bang that towel girl at the community pool. 9. DWAYNE It\\'s obvious you don\\'t know shit-all about physical fitness. You gotta bulk up first, then you slim down. I\\'m clearly in the bulk up phase. I told you to watch Pumping Iron like a month ago. If you\\'d listened to me, maybe you\\'d know what the fuck I\\'m talking about. (BEAT) Grab some RC Cola. INT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY The shades are drawn. We hear a girl scream bloody murder! The guys are watching FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3...in 3D. They both wear cheap cardboard glasses. Jay jumps back as Jason wields a 3D ax. JAY Shit, man! It\\'s so real! Dwayne reaches out, \"touching\" the 3D images. He stands and starts humping the air. DWAYNE Check it out. I ain\\'t afraid of Jason. I\\'m fucking him. (THRUSTING HARDER) You like that, Jason!? In the mask! Jay cracks up. The lights flick on. GRIZZLED VOICE (O.S.) Who are you two fags fucking? Standing by the switch is Dwayne\\'s dad, JERRY (70s). Most people just call him \"THE MAJOR.\" The faded USMC tattoo on his thick forearm explains why. JAY Afternoon, Major. Dwayne flops back onto the couch. DWAYNE Dad, we\\'re watching a flick. We got 45 minutes and a potential 3D sex scene left. You\\'re sorta coming in at the worst possible moment. 10. MAJOR I bought that TV set so I could watch my programs, not so you and your friend could louse up my couch. DWAYNE You gotta learn how to share the common space. MAJOR The only thing common in this house is you. You remind me of your damn mother. Fat, dumb, and in my way. The Major grabs Dwayne and pulls him up off the couch. He gets right in his face...scary, intense. Dwayne turns to Jay. DWAYNE Let\\'s get outta here. This movie sucks anyway. Jay gets up and files out the door. Dwayne goes to take the cold cut plate. The Major grabs his arm. MAJOR I paid for the damn cold cuts, too. Maybe if you had a job, or a fucking prospect, or a clue how to find any of the above, I\\'d let you eat \\'em. DWAYNE (QUIETLY) You know, you can be a real sonofabitch, dad. MAJOR That\\'s what it takes, boy. In the Corps, men like you wore dresses to keep us entertained. DWAYNE That\\'s pretty fucking disturbing! Dwayne storms off. EXT. NICE HOUSE - DAY Dwayne and Jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in the driveway. Dwayne spits on it. DWAYNE Fuck The Major! The guys get in a shitty Ford Aerostar minivan and peel out. 11. INT. DIVE STRIP CLUB - DAY R. Kelly\\'s \"Ignition (Remix)\" pumps. Large, fake breasts, sparkling with cheap body glitter and pierced at the nipples, shake before us. Their owner, JUICY (27), a petite Latina, phones in a lap dance as Dwayne pours his heart out to her. Somewhere in the background, Jay hangs at the bar, all alone. DWAYNE - and he thinks he knows me. He don\\'t know shit. I got ideas he could never dream of. I got plans bigger than his fucking house. (BEAT) He didn\\'t even raise me. My mother did. That was a good woman. JUICY Oh yeah? What happened to her? Dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject. DWAYNE She passed on. JUICY I hope you\\'re not one of those guys that comes here looking to get mothered. DWAYNE I wouldn\\'t mind nursing on them titties, mamacita. JUICY Sure. Whatever you say. Maybe just keep quiet for a while, forget about your old man and let me do my thing. DWAYNE I wish I could forget about that asshole for good. I\\'m just waiting around for him to drop dead. Don\\'t wanna mess with my inheritance. This piques Juicy\\'s interest. JUICY What kinda inheritance? 12. DWAYNE When my dad got outta the service, he started buying lotto tickets. He\\'d play his dog tag numbers. In \\'91, the fucker won five million bucks. INSERT PHOTO: The Major holding a giant cardboard check. DWAYNE He had some health problems a few years back, and since then he\\'s been burning through the money like an NBA draft pick. Probably only got a million or two left. But it\\'s mine as soon as he kicks. Behind inch-long fake eyelashes, Juicy\\'s shrewd eyes narrow, mind working. She straddles Dwayne, tightly. JUICY You know, with a million bucks, you could have anything. Be like a king. (almost a moan) King Dwayne. DWAYNE That\\'s right. And maybe I\\'ll make you my queen. Let you polish my royal scepter. JUICY Practice makes perfect. Juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head. Dwayne is blissed out. She smiles at him, sticky sweet. JUICY Let me ask you a question...do you really hate your daddy? DWAYNE Hate him like the Steelers. JUICY Then maybe I can help you get that money now. Before he spends another penny. Dwayne looks confused. Juicy puts his hands on her breasts, emboldening him. JUICY I know a guy in Baltimore. He could help you out. Probably do it for... (sizing him up) ...100Gs. 13. DWAYNE Do what? Juicy leans in, whispers softly in Dwayne\\'s ear - JUICY Kill your mean old dad. On Dwayne\\'s face as this new possibility pinballs around his mind, setting off a flood of different emotions. JUICY So, what do you think...you ready for your crown? INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING Will has one pizza left in the back of his car. He pulls over outside an office building. INT. LAW FIRM, OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT Rows of cubicles. Speckled with late night STRAGGLERS, bleary eyes, too busy generating detailed lists of places they\\'d rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along. Will stops before one such work station, looks on for a beat. WILL Rio? KATE (25) turns from the glow of her computer screen. She has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile. This is the girl from the picture in Will\\'s apartment. KATE That\\'s the plan. Five days, six nights. Culture. Beaches. Acceptable probability of kidnapping. I leave in the morning. Kate looks back at her computer, logged onto an Expedia checkout page for a Rio vacation. She moves the mouse pointer from the \"proceed\" key...closes the window. KATE This morning I loaded up an African Safari and a cruise to Alaska. WILL Oh, the places you\\'ll go. KATE Fuck Expedia. Travel Advisor. Making it seem so easy. 14. WILL It is. Just do it. Get away for a while. KATE Even if I could afford that...they fired two other paralegals last week. Now\\'s not the time to be putting in for vacation days. WILL Ok. Done. I\\'ve got my dose of the actual working world. Can we eat? Will lays a pizza down on her desk. KATE How do you keep sneaking up here past the security guard? WILL He\\'s there like half the time. The other half I smile at him. I\\'m relatively certain he\\'s a homosexual. KATE Interesting theory... Kate opens the pizza box, grabs a slice. KATE Maybe I should set him up with Tom Small. He came out to me today on Facebook. WILL That kid beat the hell out of me and Chet in grammar school. Wow. KATE Tell me about it. He fingered me at junior prom while they were playing \"No Scrubs.\" WILL (WINCES) Really? What a fucking scrub. Will grabs a slice. They eat quietly for a beat. KATE So, I\\'ve got some news... 15. WILL I thought the Tom Small stuff was enough of a headline, but go ahead. KATE I\\'m getting back together with Mark. Will\\'s delicious pizza suddenly tastes like shit. He does his best to swallow it down. WILL But you...you broke up with him...ended the relationship. Finality was had. KATE Yeah, but we were talking and - WILL Forget it. I don\\'t want to know. KATE You sound like Chet. WILL Woah, don\\'t compare me to your brother. KATE Well, neither one of you seems to care that I don\\'t have a life. Mark\\'s not perfect...but a relationship is better than working late every Friday because I have nowhere else to be. WILL Sure. I get it. Here we are. Friday night. Nowhere to be. Kate shoves Will, good-naturedly. KATE You know what I mean. Will shrugs, quietly devastated. Goes back to his pizza. INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT Most of the PATRONS are fixated on an Orioles game blaring from a large flat-screen TV. At a booth in back, Dwayne and Jay are in deep conversation. 16. JAY I don\\'t wanna stick my nose into a family matter...but killing your old man? That\\'s pretty messed up...I mean, unless you think it isn\\'t. DWAYNE What we have here is a classic \"lesser of two evils\" debate. You got one evil: me shaving a few years off The Major\\'s shitty life. Then you got the other evil: The Major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance. Maybe I\\'m biased, but mine sure as shit seems like the lesser. JAY I guess I...sorta see where you\\'re coming from. And you have been waiting around forever for that money. You deserve it, Dwayne. Dwayne nods, seriously. DWAYNE You know, there\\'s a reason I sleep \\'til noon everyday. And it ain\\'t \\'cause I\\'m lazy. It\\'s on account of me having so many goddamn dreams. Big ones. And once that money\\'s mine, they\\'re all gonna come true. Dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative. DWAYNE Like I had this one dream last night. I was cruising through town in a Lamborghini Diablo. The wind was blowing through my hair, ruffling my open shirt. There was a hot little piece of ass sitting next to me. And in the back seat, Jay...was you. Strapped. Wearing a pair of Oakleys. JAY Wow. I didn\\'t know you dreamt about me, Dwayne. DWAYNE It was only this once, Jay. To be honest, I didn\\'t know what to make of it. So I consulted my dream book, and found out it means this: you\\'re my road dog. You got my back. (MORE) 17. DWAYNE (CONT\\'D) That\\'s why I want to make you my partner. JAY In what? DWAYNE In crime. And business. You see, it ain\\'t just about the inheritance money. It\\'s about what I\\'m gonna do with it. Dwayne leans across the table. DWAYNE I\\'m about to clue you in on something. And then you\\'ll understand the true magnitude of what\\'s at stake here. Are you ready? JAY Yes. I\\'m totally ready. DWAYNE Then answer me this...what\\'s this town missing? I\\'ll give you a hint. It\\'s a cash business, crawling with sexy bitches. JAY (BEAT) A Chinese food restaurant? DWAYNE No. A tanning salon. (BEAT) Think about it. All that green. All that brown flesh. Jay nods, thinking about. He smiles. DWAYNE It\\'s also the perfect front for a prostitution ring. JAY Yeah, of course. Because of the booths. DWAYNE Yes. And because of the bitches. (BEAT) It can all be ours. 30 percent for you, 70 percent for me. You just gotta help me out here. 18. Jay looks conflicted. Dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover. DWAYNE I\\'m starting to wonder if my dream book was wrong about you. Maybe you sitting behind me doesn\\'t mean you\\'re my road dog. Maybe it means you\\'re plotting to stab me in the back, like some snake in the grass. JAY That\\'s crazy. I\\'d never do something like that. The dream book was right! Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes, knows it\\'s all or nothing... JAY Ok. I\\'ll do it. But I\\'m not shooting him or anything. I\\'ll hold him while you shoot him. That\\'s it. Dwayne chuckles. DWAYNE Here\\'s a fact: they don\\'t build prisons for criminals, they build them for idiots. Shit, they got three different types of CSI on TV, just laying out how the police do their business...and still, idiots like you think you can just go out and do a murder yourself. (BEAT) If you wanna be a millionaire, you gotta think like one. And millionaires don\\'t kill people. They hire assassins. Which I did. We gotta pay him on Tuesday. JAY What? Why would you do that? DWAYNE I was presented with an opportunity. I took it. 100 thousand bucks for a highly trained assassin is a steal. JAY But we don\\'t have that kinda money. DWAYNE Now we\\'re addressing the real problem: how do we get the 100 grand? \\'Cause once we get that, we get the million. (MORE) 19. DWAYNE (CONT\\'D) And once we get the million, we will literally own this town and every single thing in it. JAY I guess we could just...rob a bank. One of these local banks with nothing but a dipshit security guard. DWAYNE Again, not quite thinking like a millionaire. JAY Okay, then let\\'s hire someone to rob a bank. Dwayne thinks about this for a second. DWAYNE Fuck hiring them, we could just force someone to rob a bank for us. Like with blackmail, or death threats, or - JAY (ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY) A bomb. Everyone\\'s scared of a bomb. DWAYNE I was gonna say hypnotism...but I like that. It\\'s out of the fucking box. We just strap one to some motherfucker\\'s chest, like we did to those watermelons. Think you can you build some kinda bomb vest? JAY Yeah, I mean...camel jockeys do it in caves. I got a garage workshop. DWAYNE I\\'m pretty sure this is exactly how a millionaire would do it. And the beauty of it is: we don\\'t lose any sleep, \\'cause no one gets hurt. JAY Except The Major. DWAYNE Yeah. The Major dies. But no one gets hurt. Dwayne smiles. But a nagging thought interrupts him - 20. DWAYNE There\\'s just one problem. Where do we get our guy? \\'Cause if we do a kidnapping, then we\\'re right back where we started...doing shit that\\'s gonna get us caught. (MIND WORKING) What we need is someone to come to us...to a place where we can control the situation. Someone without any connection to us. The guys stare at each other, stumped. Until something catches Dwayne\\'s attention...a local commercial playing on the flat-screen. A PIZZA CHEF slides a pizza into a box - PIZZA CHEF (ON TV) We\\'ll deliver anywhere in 30 minutes or less! Or your pizza is free! Giorgio\\'s Trattoria, where the customer gets what they want...pronto! The guys look at each other. DWAYNE Sometimes fate just takes out its cock and slaps you in the face with it. INT. CHET\\'S APARTMENT - DAY A hand grabs a beer from the fridge. VOICE (O.S.) You\\'re not trying to draw a psycho pension...you really are crazy! Will heads into the living room with the beer. The voice belongs to Danny Glover. The guys are watching Lethal Weapon. Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just stopped Riggs (Mel Gibson) from killing himself. Riggs looks at him, crazily, before - RIGGS (ON TV) I\\'m hungry. I\\'m gonna get something to eat. Chet looks over at Will. He is drunk, and in a dark mood. CHET Maybe you should pace yourself. It\\'s noon on a Saturday. WILL Fridge is full, man. We\\'re all good. 21. Will drains half his beer. WILL Let me ask you a question. You remember Tom Small? CHET Yeah, he used to kick our asses. WILL Turns out he was probably jerking off to it afterwards. He\\'s gay. CHET I hope he chokes on a dick. I never liked him. WILL Your sister did. She let him finger blast her. Big time. Chet pauses the movie. CHET What the fuck are you talking about? I don\\'t want that shit in my head. WILL Sorry. Kate told me about it last night. I thought you should know. CHET You two were swapping stories about getting fingered? That\\'s pretty cute. Chet chuckles. Will ignores him, sips his beer. WILL The point I\\'m trying to make is this: Tom Small was an asshole. He was totally wrong for your sister. Just like every other guy she\\'s ever dated. Right through to that Mark dude she\\'s gonna get back together with. Un-be- fuck-me-lievable... CHET Whatever. Why the fuck are we talking about who my sister goes out with? At a loss, Will shrugs. Chet turns back to the TV, presses play. Lethal Weapon resumes. Something blows up. Chet pauses the movie and stares at Will for a beat. 22. CHET You sneaky son of a bitch...you want to fuck my sister, don\\'t you? WILL Chet, I really don\\'t... CHET My twin sister!? Which is basically like fucking me! WILL Hey, if you guys had that twin ESP shit this would be a completely different situation. There\\'d be logistical problems. CHET We look exactly alike! WILL You look like a lot of people. You\\'re a normal looking dude. CHET This is so fucked up I can\\'t even begin to process it. How long has this been going on? WILL If I had to put my finger on it...middle school-ish. CHET So all those sleepovers, they were just some kind of opportunity for you to peek in Kate\\'s bedroom? WILL It might have happened a few times. Most of them were accidental. CHET You\\'re a peeping Tom. You realize that, don\\'t you? You\\'re a sexual fucking deviant. WILL Fuck you. I\\'m as normal as they come. Your sister is attractive. She excites me, in a sexual way. Fucking sue me. Can\\'t we just be adults about it? 23. CHET You? An adult? Sort of stretching the term. WILL Hey, let\\'s not say shit we can\\'t take back. CHET Take back? Will, you got kicked out of junior college for punching a professor that made fun of some poem you wrote. WILL That poem was about your sister! CHET That is, literally, the saddest thing I have ever heard. Like retards playing freeze tag sad. No wonder you deliver pizzas for a living. WILL Fuck you! Maybe I was just hanging out with you for your sister. You were always a whiny little bitch. And you stuttered. All the kids used to call you \"Chutter.\" CHET Whatever. I only started hanging out with you because you had a Nintendo. WILL Did you see my Nintendo naked? Because I saw your sister changing into her swimsuit at your thirteenth birthday pool party. And it was the highlight of the whole shitty event. Chet bites his lip. CHET Okay. You wanna do this? WILL I think we already are. CHET Well, you know who I saw naked? Jenny Rifkin. While I was nailing her. The week after she dumped you. (MORE) 24. CHET (CONT\\'D) Why do you think every time you wanna bet on whose cock\\'s bigger I\\'m always willing to go in? \\'Cause I know mine\\'s bigger. \\'Cause she told me! WILL Wow...wow. You pulled a Judas on Jenny fucking Rifkin. That is messed up. Almost as messed up as how I sold your Cal Ripken signed ball for 200 bucks. CHET My grandpa left me that ball in his will! You helped me look for it for a month! WILL Now you know why we never found it. Will bows. WILL We done here? Chet\\'s face is red with anger. CHET Not quite yet. There\\'s actually a mystery I wanna solve for you. (BEAT) I was the one who told John Tanner about how your mom fucked that lifeguard. And I always felt awful about it, because even though he swore secrecy, he told everyone else in town. And then your parents wound up getting divorced. But now...I don\\'t give a shit. WILL What!? You ruined...my fucking life! Will takes a swing at Chet. He dodges it and puts Will in some sort of choke hold. CHET Krav Maga, bitch. I bet your poetry professor didn\\'t know this shit. WILL Get offa me! CHET You threw the first punch! 25. WILL I\\'m gonna break this hold and then kick your skinny ass! CHET Try it! Will flexes and tries to break the choke hold...no luck. He wrenches his back away from Chet and screams - WILL What the fuck is that!? CHET My knuckle in your spine! No holds barred you backstabbing fuck! WILL I\\'m gonna pass out... CHET Good! WILL (face bright red) I love her, Chet...I love Kate... Chet lets Will go. He drops to the floor, panting. CHET Let me tell you something. And it\\'s the truest thing you\\'ll ever hear, from the person who knows you best in the world...you\\'re not good enough for my sister. And you never will be. You\\'re the lowest common denominator, Will. You\\'re the square root of fucking zero. Will gets to his feet. WILL Fuck you...Chutter! (GRABS DICK) Square this! CHET Get out of my house. You\\'re a shitty friend. WILL Right back at you. Will storms out. 26. EXT. CHET\\'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Will screeches away in his car. INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT A day or so has passed. Will sits on his couch, an unshaven mess, watching Lethal Weapon 2. Murtaugh and Riggs laugh and joke around. Best buds. Will looks like he might cry. He goes for his beer, knocks it over. He stares at the growing puddle of beer...then grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them to sop it up. INT. GIORGIO\\'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT Will sits at a table, looking out through the misty window. Christopher boxes a pizza and drops it in front of him. CHRISTOPHER Come on, wake up and get to work. Christopher hands him the order slip. Will checks the address. WILL Where the fuck is this? CHRISTOPHER How should I know? It\\'s 30 minutes away or the pizza comes out of your paycheck. Tick tock. EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT Will\\'s Mustang travels down a dark, empty stretch of highway. The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into the distance. EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT The Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway. Overgrown shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view. All that Will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the sky, beacon light flashing atop it. Will checks the address, then drives through the open gate. EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway. Will gets out. There is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio tower built on top of a small office structure. 27. The office door is ajar. Florescent light glows from inside. WILL Hello? DWAYNE (O.S.) (calling back from beyond door) Hey, bud! Sorry for the hike! The county\\'s got us doing repairs at the ass end of the night! This puts Will at ease. He heads toward the office. As he gets close, a figure appears in the doorway. It is Dwayne WEARING A SCARY FUCKING GORILLA MASK WILL What the - Will hears something behind him and whirls around - To find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him. WILL Holy fuck! Will makes a run for it. But the guys are on top of him in no time. He madly fights them off and dashes for his car. DWAYNE Stop! We got a gun, you asshole! Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery. DWAYNE Fuck! Get him! Jay is right on Will\\'s tail. Without breaking stride, Jay picks up a large branch and wings it at him. Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. Jay leaps on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Will\\'s body. WILL What the hell!? (at a loss) Rape! Jay wrestles something from his pocket. A chloroform soaked rag. He presses it hard against Will\\'s mouth and nose. Will soon goes limp. Dwayne appears, looming above them. He pulls his gorilla mask back and smiles. 28. DWAYNE Step one. CUT TO: Blurry vision coming into focus. Two gorillas. EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY Whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous now. Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at his captors. His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his back. He wears his \"Giorgio\\'s\" cap and a buttoned up olive green Army jacket. DWAYNE You thought we were gonna rape you. (CHUCKLES) Idiot. Will mumbles something through the duct tape. DWAYNE Just shut up. The tape is there for a reason. \\'Cause this next part is gonna take a measure of calm. Are you with me? Can you be calm? Will nods. Dwayne holds up his driver license. DWAYNE Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever- The-Fuck Street, right now you are wearing an explosive vest. Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get his hands loose so he can tear it open. DWAYNE Calm the fuck down! Will stiffens. For emphasis, Dwayne reveals the gun tucked down the front of his pants like a big metal cock. DWAYNE Now stay still and my associate will show you. Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket. Will is, in fact, wearing an explosive vest. It is a cobbled together but intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored wires. There is a thick lock at the hinge, with a digital display and a keypad. Will begins to hyperventilate. 29. JAY Take it easy, man. You\\'re fine. I built this thing. It\\'s pretty stable. DWAYNE For a fucking bomb. So don\\'t trip over your shoelaces or anything. That thing\\'s full of C-4. And the C is for chaos. JAY Actually, the C stands for \"composite.\" But, yeah, I\\'d try not to slam into stuff. DWAYNE Can I take that tape off now, pizza boy? Will nods. Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth. WILL Help! Dwayne chuckles. DWAYNE You know where you are? You might as well be in space, motherfucker. Nobody can hear you scream. WILL Why are you doing this to me? I don\\'t have any money. DWAYNE Not yet. But you\\'re gonna go get us some. WILL Okay. Sure, man. Whatever you say. I\\'ll go sell my car. I\\'ll get you like a thousand bucks. DWAYNE I want 100 thousand. WILL Where the fuck am I supposed to get that much money? DWAYNE The Donner-Wells National Bank on Charles Road. 30. JAY Across the street from the Olive Garden. DWAYNE Yeah, the one across the street from the Olive Garden. WILL Do you guys have an account or something? Dwayne shakes his head like Will is an idiot. DWAYNE No, I don\\'t have an account! You\\'re gonna rob it! WILL How the fuck am I supposed to rob a bank? DWAYNE Figure it out. You got a bomb strapped to your chest. That\\'s a start. It\\'ll scare the fuck outta people. Maybe use your brain and go get a gun. Borrow one from a friend for all I care. It ain\\'t rocket science. WILL Then do it yourself. DWAYNE I would, but I\\'m already wearing this gorilla mask and you\\'re already wearing that bomb. (TO JAY) Tell him about the vest. Jay turns to Will. JAY You seem like a pretty trustworthy guy. I mean, you got a job and all. But just in case you were gonna try to take the vest off, we booby trapped it to shit. There\\'s also a remote detonator on the back, so we can trigger it by dialing a number. DWAYNE And it\\'s on speed dial. So do what you gotta do, but we\\'ll be watching. (MORE) 31. DWAYNE (CONT\\'D) You go anywhere near a police station, and Fourth of July comes early this year. Dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest. DWAYNE It\\'s 9:00 AM. You got 8 hours. He hands Will a slip of paper. DWAYNE Once you have the money, call this number and you\\'ll be given instructions on where to drop it. You do good, we give you the six-digit combination that stops the timer and opens the lock. Tomorrow morning, you can go back to delivering pizza, the mail, whatever the fuck you want. (BEAT) Now let me demonstrate what happens if you don\\'t get us the money. Dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away. Dwayne mimes answering a phone - DWAYNE Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what\\'s that? You don\\'t have the money? It was too tough to rob the bank, so you just went back to your bear cave and cried like a bitch? Well, guess what my stuffed friend...time is up. Jay pushes a button on a detonator. Teddy Ruxpin explodes. All that remains is a cloud of stuffing. Will is frozen in fear. DWAYNE I liked that bear. I don\\'t even know you. Dwayne throws Will his car keys. DWAYNE Go on. Get outta here. WILL Guys, can we please just talk about this? 32. DWAYNE Yeah, of course we can. Dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will\\'s feet. Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side. DWAYNE Be careful! Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. As he starts the engine and backs away - DWAYNE That\\'s right! Get the fuck out of here! You\\'re wasting time! Once the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask. Dwayne stays primate. JAY What the hell, Dwayne? You told me that was a replica gun. DWAYNE It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50 bucks to put a firing pin in it. Now it goes boom. JAY We didn\\'t discuss a loaded gun! Especially not with the bomb around! Dwayne gets right in Jay\\'s face. The plastic eyes of his mask betray no emotion. DWAYNE Don\\'t you ever question me. I\\'m fucking this bitch. You\\'re just holding the camera. JAY (VOICE FALTERS) Sure, Dwayne...whatever you say. DWAYNE Good. \\'Cause this ain\\'t the Marines. This is cash money. You hesitate, you fuck up...and I will leave you behind. A tense beat. Dwayne pulls his mask off. He looks oddly calm. DWAYNE Let\\'s go get some breakfast. 33. EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY Will\\'s car flies down the road. It screeches to a stop, tires smoking. Will jumps out, stumbles to the shoulder and pukes. He drops to his knees. WILL Oh, god! Holy shit! Fuck me! Someone please fucking help me! Nothing but the wind. Will fights back tears. He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth. He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts. He pauses on Chet\\'s name...presses send. The line goes to voicemail. Will looks at the bomb\\'s timer: 7 hours, 47 minutes and counting. He hurries to his car. INT. CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY A laser dot dances around the middle of a United States map. Chet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of SEVENTH GRADERS that look very mature and very bored. As he indicates with his laser pointer - CHET This whole region here, about 830 thousand square miles, was part of the initial Louisiana Purchase. SEVENTH GRADER (COUGHING) Nice laser. The class giggles. Chet, embarrassed, puts away the pointer. There is a knock at the door. Chet turns to see Will\\'s face in the door\\'s window pane. He looks back to his class. CHET Take out your workbooks. Chapter 3. Chet opens the door. CHET What do you want? WILL We gotta talk. CHET I\\'m working here. Do not mess with me at work. 34. WILL Chet, for the love of god, just talk to me in private for one minute. Chet sighs. INT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY Chet leads a jumpy Will into INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY Chet shuts the door behind them. Will paces. CHET You wanna apologize, don\\'t you? You look like shit. You\\'ve probably been up for days thinking about what an asshole you were. Well, it\\'s gonna take a lot more than some pathetic groveling - WILL (SUDDENLY) Chet! Shut up! I don\\'t wanna apologize to you! CHET Then what do you want? Because we don\\'t have anything left to say to each other. Will swallows hard. WILL Here goes. And this is gonna sound crazy. Because it is fucking crazy. But last night two guys in masks jumped me and strapped a bomb to my chest, and now I have less than eight hours to rob a bank. Chet just stares at Will, unimpressed. CHET You\\'re hysterical. Got me. Great joke. I\\'m going back to work now. Will steps in Chet\\'s way. He unbuttons his jacket, revealing the bomb. CHET What the fuck? Is that real? Will nods. 35. Chet jumps backward, stumbles over a desk and scurries on his ass to the other end of the classroom. He presses himself flat against the wall. CHET Stay away from me! What the fuck are you involved in!? Terrorism!? WILL Chet, do you really think I\\'m a terrorist? CHET Yes! One of the dumb ones! The ones they convince to wear the bombs! WILL I am not fucking around here. Two guys did this to me. And if I don\\'t rob that bank in time this thing is gonna blow. CHET Seriously? WILL Seriously. CHET And your first idea was to come to a school filled with young children? WILL I didn\\'t - CHET Just back the fuck away from me with that thing. Will backs all the way up, so that the guys are on opposite ends of the classroom. WILL Listen, I think the vest is safe for now. These guys don\\'t want me to blow myself up on accident before I get their money. CHET Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths that rigged a bomb to your chest made sure it was safe? There\\'s no margin for error in their fucking bomb vest design!? 36. WILL I don\\'t know! All I do know is that this is real. This is happening. And I\\'m sure you hate me as much as I hate you right now, but I have nowhere else to go. CHET For what? WILL For help, Chet. I need your help. Please. I can\\'t do this alone. Chet looks Will over. His desperation is palpable. Chet bites his lip, weighing the situation... CHET Damn it! (takes a breath) I\\'d like to tell you to get fucked, but you know what the problem is...I\\'m a better man than you. And someday, I might actually forgive you. So if I let you blow up, or whatever, that shit might come back and eat at my conscience, and totally affect my relationships with other people. Like my wife and kids and shit. WILL That\\'s a...very rational way to look at the situation. (GENUINELY) And you\\'re right, about being a better guy than me. Chet takes a step toward Will. CHET Are you sure that thing isn\\'t gonna blow at any second? Will just looks at Chet...unable to offer any assurance. After a beat - CHET Could you just walk a few feet in front of me for a while? WILL I can do that. Will opens the door, stops, looks back at Chet. 37. WILL Thank you. Will heads out. Chet takes a breath, bracing himself. INT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY Will walks down the empty hallway. He glances back over his shoulder, where Chet walks several feet behind him. CHET Yes, I\\'m still here. I really am this stupid. Just pay attention to where you\\'re going. WILL I think I can handle it. CHET These floors get waxed once a week. On Tuesday, which today is. You hit a slick patch, trip and fall, and I got a classroom full of kids wearing their skin inside out. WILL Chet, I\\'m fucking nervous enough as it is. Please. I don\\'t need you back seat driving me right now. CHET Obviously. Will stops, turns back toward Chet. WILL Just for the record, this isn\\'t a nuclear weapon strapped to my chest. And there are metal lockers on either side of the hallway. If I fall, and if this thing goes off, I\\'m probably not taking out the whole school. CHET Do you really want to debate this? Will sighs, turns back around. A second later, the school bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes. Will freezes. Multiple kids shove past him. Chet sweats bullets, gives Will a look of death. After a beat, the hallway empties again. 38. CHET You\\'re an asshole. WILL Whatever. It\\'s over. Will continues walking. He tries to lighten the mood - WILL Who was the chick in the white jeans? CHET Kristi Evans. Why? WILL You know why. CHET Oh, come on. Just keep walking. The guys\\' voices fade as they continue down the hallway... WILL Come on yourself. You knew exactly who I was talking about. CHET Fuck you. She\\'s in the eighth grade. WILL I bet you love it when she calls you Mr. Chet. CHET She doesn\\'t call me \"Mr. Chet.\" She\\'s not a foreigner. EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY The guys get to Will\\'s car. Chet wraps up a call on his cell - CHET ...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis. I\\'ll call you after I talk to the doctor. Chet hangs up. He is standing by the passenger door. He looks over the roof of the car at Will. CHET So, this is it? WILL This is what? 39. CHET Once I step inside this car, I\\'m basically in a steel coffin with you and...that thing. And if it goes off, all they\\'re gonna find in there are two charred bodies and pieces of a bomb. They\\'ll assume we were driving to a government building to blow it up. It\\'ll be all over the news. Next thing you now, some militia or Islam group is claiming us as members. My family will be humiliated. WILL We\\'ll also be dead, in that particular situation, so it won\\'t really matter. CHET Exactly! Will sighs. WILL I get it. Take your time, man. Will gets in the car and shuts the door. He looks out at Chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side. CHET This is the world\\'s biggest favor, you motherfucker. You didn\\'t even help me move last winter. Chet reluctantly hops in. INT. MUSTANG - DAY Will fires up the engine. CHET Given the situation, I think you should obey all traffic safety laws. WILL Fine. Will pulls out of the school parking lot. WILL Okay, so where are we going? CHET I have no idea. I just got in your car. I thought you had a plan. 40. WILL Well, I don\\'t! I\\'ve been sorta preoccupied with this crushing fear of death! CHET No plan. I can\\'t say I\\'m surprised. WILL Your plan is probably better. Just condescend me until I explode. Will goes to turn on the radio. Chet grabs his hand. CHET Maybe we should turn on the radio. See if the signal sets the bomb off. That would be an interesting experiment. Will heaves a frustrated sigh. Chet eases up. CHET Listen, let\\'s just go back to my place. Figure out our options. Maybe you can get the vest off or something. I just don\\'t want to do anything stupid. WILL Unless we have to. The car hits a rough pothole. Chet\\'s heart skips a beat - CHET Holy fucking shit! - and he throws himself against the passenger side window, as far from Will as the confines of the car will allow. Will slams the brakes. WILL Stop it! You\\'re scaring the fuck out of me! CHET Okay. Okay. Fuck! Chet makes the sign of the cross. CHET I\\'m cool now. Will continues driving. Chet discreetly unlocks the passenger side door. 41. WILL Why did you do that? CHET Do what? WILL I saw you. CHET It\\'s in case I have to jump out. WILL If I survive the day, and you don\\'t because you jumped out of a moving car and broke your neck, I\\'m gonna laugh my ass off. CHET And if abandoning ship saves my life, then that laugh will be mine. The guys continue driving in silence. SUPER COUNTDOWN: 6 hours, 59 minutes... CUT TO: INT. BATHROOM, CHET\\'S APARTMENT - DAY The door is shut. Will sits on the toilet lid. He has the jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest. The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes. The wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated, purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it. Will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he can slide the vest off...no luck. WILL It\\'s too tight! He is calling off toward the KITCHEN Where Chet is crouched in a corner, at the furthest point in the furthest room from the bathroom. He uses his laptop to look for websites on disarming a bomb. CHET What if we try to separate your shoulder? 42. WILL (O.S.) Fuck you! CHET Well, all these sites say different shit. There\\'s not a lot of consensus in the bomb disarming community. Will emerges from the bathroom, sliding the jacket back on. WILL This is pointless. Chet shuts his laptop. CHET I agree. We gotta call the cops, have them fly in the bomb squad or something. WILL We can\\'t. These guys said they\\'d be following me. And I don\\'t have a clue what they look like. For all I know, they\\'re outside right now. They see the cops show up, they blow the vest and cut their losses. Will stares at Chet, hopelessly overwhelmed. WILL What do I do, man? What do I do now? CHET I don\\'t know, Will...I guess you gotta rob the bank. WILL I haven\\'t been inside a bank in three years! How the fuck am I supposed to rob one!? They wouldn\\'t even give me a savings account! Will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands, fighting hysterics. Chet offers a stock reassurance - CHET It\\'s gonna be okay. WILL No, it\\'s not! I\\'m gonna blow up! That\\'s way worse than getting stabbed or shot. At least some people survive that. No one survives being blown up. (MORE) 43. WILL (CONT\\'D) No one is ever like, \"Yeah, I heard Steve got blown up, tough break, but how\\'s he doing now? Is he still in the Rec basketball league?\" No of course he isn\\'t, \\'cause there\\'s nothing left of Steve except a stain on the wall and a pair of fucking high tops! Chet looks on as his friend begins to sob. It\\'s a crushing sight. Chet strides across the apartment - CHET Pull yourself together! - and attempts to give him one of those \"get a grip\" slaps. But Will flinches and Chet slaps him right on the ear. WILL Ow! Fuck! I think you popped my eardrum. CHET Sorry. Shit. I didn\\'t mean to do that. But just listen to me now. You\\'re not gonna die. You wanna know why? Because you know exactly how to rob a bank. WILL What are you talking about? CHET Point Break. WILL The movie? CHET Yes. That movie is like a how-to guide for bank robberies. You just bust in. Masks. Guns. Move fast. Stick to the tellers and don\\'t bother with the vault. WILL Yeah...I guess it\\'s pretty simple, right? And it\\'s just a local bank. The Donner-Wells on Charles Road. CHET Really? I applied for a job there like a year ago. 44. WILL You wanted to be a teller? CHET Yeah, so what? It\\'s a good job. You get benefits. WILL Like what, a name tag? CHET What kind of benefits do you get? Free toppings? WILL That\\'s really clever. No one ever said that shit to me before. Anyway, this is perfect. You know the whole layout of the bank. CHET Not exactly. They didn\\'t hand me the security schematics with the application. But I sat in the waiting area for like 20 minutes. I know what the place looks like. WILL How many guards? CHET One. I think. WILL That\\'s a start. CHET It\\'s a great start. You can do it. Will pauses. WILL You\\'re gonna do it with me, right? CHET I was actually gonna stick to giving tips, ideas...motivational speeches. More of a consultant or advisory role. WILL Jesus Christ, Chet. Please. I\\'m begging you here. I need you on this. If I do it alone, I\\'m dead. 45. CHET Are you gonna cry again? WILL That was a moment of weakness. (BEAT) Yes. I\\'ll fucking cry again if that\\'s what it takes. CHET I should make you blow me. WILL Sure. Whip that shit out. I\\'m actually kinda curious. I wanna see if Jenny Rifkin lied to you. She obviously lied to me. Chet cracks a smile. WILL All these guys want is 100 grand. We can do this. CHET We\\'re gonna rob a bank for 100 grand? Just leave the rest of the money sitting there? Why? WILL I don\\'t know. I guess they\\'re very modest criminals. Who the fuck cares? Wait...you said \"we\" right? Chet heaves a sigh. CHET I\\'m putting my life on the line for 100 grand...what does 100 grand even buy these days? CUT TO: THE GRILLE OF A MURDERED OUT 1997 NISSAN SENTRA As the car pulls into EXT. BACK PARKING LOT, DIVE STRIP CLUB - DAY Where Juicy waits by the service entrance, smoking a cigarette. She spots the car and runs over. It parks and the door opens. A glassy-eyed African-American man (30s) steps out. His muscled body is covered in calligraphic prison ink. This is VAUGHN. 46. Juicy throws her arms around him. JUICY I missed you so much, baby. VAUGHN You don\\'t got enough dicks to keep you warm in that place? JUICY You know it\\'s not like that. Those guys get Juicy, but you get Marisol. VAUGHN Well, Marisol...what I want is to get my money, kill that old ass man, then get the fuck out of here. JUICY Then that\\'s how it\\'s gonna go. We\\'re just waiting on a call. Vaughn stares at her. VAUGHN This is my impatient face. JUICY Well, I think I can keep you entertained. Juicy gets in the open driver side door and makes a show of crawling over into the passenger seat. INT. WALMART - DAY Fluorescent lights and pop music. Will and Chet roam the aisles with a full shopping basket. They turn into the \"Sports & Fitness\" section, where they find a variety of air pistols. They are incredibly realistic, though clear and with orange nozzles. WILL Should we go with the handguns...or the Uzis? CHET Handguns. WILL That\\'s such a Murtaugh choice. CUT TO: 47. A check out conveyor belt, as the guys\\' purchases drift past: air pistols, spray paint, ski masks, leather gloves, several 5-Hour Energy drinks. The tough REGISTER WOMAN looks at the guys with abject disgust. REGISTER WOMAN You sure you don\\'t want to grab some condoms? WILL Uh, no. Why? REGISTER WOMAN Because this is usually what men buy before they rape someone, and I want to make sure you all use protection. WILL Lady, we\\'re just...buying some stuff. REGISTER WOMAN Is that cash or credit for your rape kit? Will looks in his empty wallet, takes out a credit card. Chet grabs his hand. CHET We\\'ll pay cash. INT. MINIVAN - DAY The van is parked. Dwayne sits behind the wheel. Metallica\\'s \"Ride the Lightning\" begins to play loudly. DWAYNE You really fucked up this mix tape. Dwayne ejects the tape, tosses it at Jay in the passenger seat. DWAYNE We\\'re not speed freaks knocking off a 7-Eleven. We\\'re masterminding a heist here. JAY Sorry, Dwayne. That song just means a lot to me. Dwayne shakes his head. He turns and looks out the windshield: they\\'re parked in the Walmart lot, watching the store entrance. DWAYNE I wish he would hurry his shit up. 48. JAY You worried about that other guy he\\'s with? DWAYNE No, man. He picked him up at a school. So long as there ain\\'t any cops, he can take the whole town with him. I just want my money. Dwayne surveys the area. Something catches his attention: the bland strip mall across the street. There\\'s a Blockbuster, Subway, and an empty space in between. Dwayne smiles. JAY What? You want me to run over to Subway, get us a couple sandwiches? DWAYNE If you had any vision, Jay, you\\'d know exactly what I\\'m thinking about right now. And it\\'s not a sandwich. (BEAT) Look how well trafficked that shopping mall is. It\\'s the perfect place for the tanning salon. Jay checks it out, nods. JAY Oh, you\\'re totally right. DWAYNE I\\'ve been thinking about it, and I want you to start off working the counter. Sounds like a demotion, I know, but it\\'s an important position. Because we\\'re gonna be using code words and shit. For example, if a customer walks in and says he wants a tan, that just means he wants a tan. But if he says he wants a \"deluxe tan,\" that means a blow job and you gotta get one of the girls in there to suck him off. You with me? JAY So far. But what if he wants a fuck? DWAYNE There\\'s gonna be codes for everything: missionary, anal, black chicks. I got it all written down back home in my files. (MORE) 49. DWAYNE (CONT\\'D) I\\'m not gonna bother getting into it with you right now, because you\\'re supposed to be on lookout and you\\'re no good at multitasking. JAY Okay. \\'Cause they\\'re about to get away. Dwayne spots the Mustang pulling away. DWAYNE Fuck. He throws the van into gear. INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING Will navigates the streets. Chet is in the back seat, where he has newspaper spread out and is spray painting the air pistols, and much of the car, black. WILL Be careful, you\\'re getting paint everywhere. CHET Are you really worried about your upholstery right now? WILL Yes, because if I survive this shit I\\'m quitting my job. That means I\\'ll probably have to give up my place and I\\'ll be sleeping in the back of my car, which you\\'re covering in toxic paint. Chet touches up one of the guns, goes to flip it over. WILL That side isn\\'t dry yet. You\\'re about to ruin it. CHET It says it\\'s fast drying. WILL Fast isn\\'t the same as instant. You gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes. CHET How would you know? You do a lot of graffiti? 50. WILL No, but I spray painted my bike last year after I got my license suspended. I didn\\'t let it dry properly and I fucked it up. CHET We don\\'t have time to sit around and literally watch paint dry. Aren\\'t we going straight to the bank? WILL I was actually thinking we need to stop and steal a car first. Chet drops the spray paint, whirls on Will. CHET What? No way! We\\'ve got a car. WILL Yeah, my car. I\\'m not gonna use it as a getaway vehicle. They can trace the plates. Even if we do get away, we\\'ll be arrested. CHET Well, I can\\'t hotwire a fucking automobile, and neither can you. WILL That\\'s why I was thinking we\\'d steal one from your parents\\' friends. The Fishers. Remember how they used to pay us to clean their garage? They leave the keys in there. And they have a Datsun. That\\'s a fast car. CHET I\\'m not stealing the Fishers\\' Datsun. Let\\'s steal a car from your parents\\' friends. Will seethes. He whips the car over to the side of the road and gets in Chet\\'s face. WILL What friends? My parents don\\'t have any. My dad moved away after your big mouth ruined his marriage and humiliated him, and no one wanted to hang out with the mom who everyone knew fucked a lifeguard. 51. CHET You never should have told me! I was 13 years old. I couldn\\'t process that kind of information. I had to tell someone else. (shakes his head) Fuck. I really am sorry about it. Okay? Despite what I said before. I was just a kid, but I messed up. WILL Okay. Chet looks at Will, expectantly. CHET That\\'s it? You\\'re not gonna apologize for selling my Cal Ripken ball? WILL Sure. I\\'m sorry...I\\'m sorry that my family was going through a rough patch and I was smoking a ton of weed and listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the time. And that I needed some extra dough to indulge my habit. Which, in hindsight, was probably just a cry for help. But you never even noticed. CHET Thanks. Now I feel even worse. Will sits there, stewing for a moment. Then he softens - WILL I shouldn\\'t have stolen the ball. I knew it was wrong and I regretted it like the next day. I actually tried to buy it back but the guy wanted twice as much. I had to smoke even more weed just to get past the whole shitty incident. I guess that\\'s why they call it a downward spiral. CHET I appreciate that you tried to buy it back. So, thanks. An awkward moment passes. CHET We should probably get going. Will turns back around, goes to pull out without looking and - 52. A horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at them. Will slams the brakes, barely avoiding a collision. CHET Fuck! Fuck! I just want this goddamn day to be over! As Chet continues to freak - SUPER COUNTDOWN: 5 hours, 15 minutes... CUT TO: EXT. THE FISHERS\\' GARAGE - DAY Will keeps watch of the house. Chet squeezes through a garage window he has pried open. INT. THE FISHERS\\' GARAGE - DAY Chet drops ungracefully to the floor, right beside a well maintained 1977 Datsun 240Z. Chet hurries over and unlocks the side door. Will enters, hauling the Walmart bag of supplies. He goes right for a set of hooks on the wall. WILL The keys aren\\'t here. They always used to leave the keys out. CHET Yeah. When we were teenagers. This is fucked. WILL Let\\'s just find them. The guys ransack the garage. Chet knocks over a shelf full of clutter. CHET Sorry. Will goes to the car and tries the handle. It\\'s open. He scours the interior. CHET You hear that? WILL What? Chet peeks through the glass pane in the door. 53. CHET Mr. Fisher is coming! As he looks for an escape - CHET Oh shit, oh shit. Are the keys in there? WILL No! Will hops out of the car. He rifles through the Walmart bag. CHET What are you doing? Will pulls the ski masks out of the bag, along with one of the freshly painted air pistols. WILL I\\'m doing what I have to. Will puts a ski mask on, then throws one to Chet. The door opens and MR. FISHER (60s) enters. Chet quickly pulls down his mask. It\\'s backwards. Will levels the pistol - MR. FISHER Oh, Jesus! Mr. Fisher braces himself against a wall. Chet fumbles to turn his mask around. Will affects a deep voice - WILL Where are the car keys? MR. FISHER They\\'re in my pocket! I\\'m just reaching in my pocket for the keys! WILL Quiet down and do it already. Mr. Fisher reaches into his pocket and produces the keys. They jingle as he holds them out in his trembling hand. Will snatches them. WILL Now listen, I don\\'t want you to report this car stolen or anything until later tonight. Let\\'s say 5 o\\'clock. 6 to be safe. 54. MR. FISHER Sure. Anything you say. Will seems unconvinced. He looks to Chet, who shrugs. Will turns back to Mr. Fisher and gestures violently with the gun - WILL If you fuck with us, I swear, I will...I will shoot your son. Taylor. I know where he works. At the fucking travel agency. He\\'s the douchebag with the bangs. MR. FISHER (STUNNED) Please no. I won\\'t do anything. I won\\'t. Just leave Taylor alone. WILL I\\'m gonna trust you. But if you call the police, there\\'s gonna be an undertaker styling his stupid fucking bangs! (BEAT) Now open the garage door. Mr. Fisher hits a switch that raises the garage door. Chet grabs their stuff and gets in the passenger side. Will backs toward the driver side. WILL The car\\'s insured, right? Mr. Fisher nods. WILL Okay. I feel better. Worse comes to worst, something happens to it, you can get a Honda. This thing doesn\\'t even have airbags. MR. FISHER Please, just go. Will slides into the car and starts it up. EXT. THE FISHERS\\' GARAGE - DAY The car peels away. INT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING The guys yank off their ski masks. 55. CHET That old man\\'s got a heart condition! You could have killed him! WILL My hand was forced! Chet tries to get comfortable in the seat. CHET Awesome. I\\'m stuck inside an even smaller car with you and a bomb. Will works the manual transmission. He steps on the gas. WILL This thing\\'s got some pickup. CHET Could you just take it easy, we\\'re doing fine on time. WILL I know...but there\\'s one last stop we have to make. CHET Do you have to take a piss first? Because I do. Will nervously drums his fingers on the steering wheel, trying to figure out how to say - WILL I need to see your sister. CHET Are you for real? Did you really just ask me that? You salt-in-an- open-wound motherfucker! WILL Chet, as if it isn\\'t apparent, I may die today. I\\'ll probably die today. And if there\\'s one small thing that\\'s clear to me now, it\\'s that I\\'ve wasted two and a half decades as a pussy, watching everything I want pass me by. I don\\'t wanna peace out of this world as a pussy. I need to tell her how I feel. CHET You\\'re really gonna turn this into some sort of dying wish bullshit? 56. WILL Yes, I really am. It means that much to me. I am not fucking around here. CHET I don\\'t think you are. I mean, apparently, you love my sister so much that you\\'re willing to put her life in danger by going to see her with a bomb strapped to your chest. WILL She won\\'t be in danger. I promise. I got it all worked out. And you can even take a piss while I\\'m inside. EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY The Datsun pulls around and parks in back. PULL BACK TO REVEAL the minivan parking across the street. INT. MINIVAN - DAY Dwayne and Jay watch Will hurry out of the Datsun. DWAYNE Where the fuck is he going? What\\'s in there? Some sort of FBI headquarters? I told that guy not to fuck around! Dwayne pulls out his cell phone, punches in the speed dial code. His finger hovers above the send button. DWAYNE Maybe I should give that bomb a call. JAY No! Let me just go see what he\\'s up to. Dwayne smirks. DWAYNE I was just fucking around. Are you gay for this guy or something? JAY I just wanna get the money, Dwayne. Same as you. DWAYNE All right. Then man up and go check it out. As Jay reaches for the door handle - 57. DWAYNE Don\\'t even tell me you\\'re about to do a reconnaissance without a cover. What\\'s you cover? JAY I don\\'t know...I\\'m from the telephone company? DWAYNE Yeah, nice fucking uniform. Dwayne rummages in the back of the car, produces a shopping bag and starts filling it with random clothes strewn across the car. He shoves the bag at Jay. DWAYNE You\\'re a personal shopper. You\\'re delivering the latest fashions to Mr. Quilby in marketing. Got it? Jay nods, hops out with the bag and slams the door. Dwayne looks down at the cell phone in his hand, twirls it as he hums a revival song...sings the lyrics, softly - DWAYNE \"He\\'s got the whole world in his hands. He\\'s got whole fucking world in his hands...\" INT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY Will runs up the stairs, a phone pressed to his ear - WILL ...no, I\\'m here right now. KATE (O.S.) (OVER PHONE) Why are you acting so strange? WILL Because strange shit is going on. I\\'ll explain everything. Just meet me where I texted you. KATE (O.S.) WILL - WILL Please. Just do it. 58. EXT. ROOF, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY You can see the entire shitty town from up here. The access door opens and Kate emerges, wind tousling her short hair. KATE (CALLING OUT) Will? Will waves at her from where he is standing, way across on the other side of the roof. Kate starts toward him. WILL Stop! Will takes out his cell phone and dials. Kate\\'s phone rings. She answers it, confused. KATE What are you doing? We STAY on Will. We can see Kate, standing 30 feet away, but her voice comes over Will\\'s cell phone, with a delay that is slightly jarring. WILL Just don\\'t come any closer. KATE Why not? What\\'s going on? WILL I\\'m gonna give you the short version of an incredibly complicated and fucked up situation, so please be cool. (BEAT) Some very bad guys strapped a bomb to my chest and they are forcing me to commit a crime. KATE Will, I swear, if this is - WILL I wish I was joking, but I\\'m not. I know it\\'s a lot to swallow, but you gotta take it on face value, because there\\'s a timer attached to this thing and it\\'s counting down. Kate\\'s voice falters - KATE Oh my god, Will...we\\'ll get help. I\\'ll get you help. 59. WILL I didn\\'t come here for help. I\\'m taking care of it. I came here because, should things not work out today as I would like them to, I want you to know why I was doing the things I did. KATE Please, just let me call someone. Let me do something. This is crazy! WILL I don\\'t disagree with you. It\\'s fucking nuts. But that\\'s not even what this is about. (STRUGGLING) Do you remember when you found that picture in my car of you, me and Chet, with Chet cut out of it? KATE Will, I can\\'t remember about some stupid picture while you\\'re - WILL I need you to remember about the picture, and about how I stop by your office every Friday, and how I\\'ve always hated all your boyfriends, and how the two girls I\\'ve ever seriously dated have looked like less attractive versions of you. (BEAT) Do you see where I\\'m going with this? I love you Kate. I have for a very long time. Kate is barely holding it together. KATE Will, this is a lot you\\'re putting on me! You just told me people are trying to kill you or something, and now you say you love me. What the fuck is going on? WILL A whole lot of shit. I\\'m sorry to do this to you, but I was afraid I\\'d never get the chance to tell you. And I know you have feelings for me, too. Maybe you feel for me the way you feel for a good friend, or - if the world fucking hates me - a brother. (MORE) 60. WILL (CONT\\'D) But what I hope is that you don\\'t really know how you feel for me, and that maybe when you figure it out you\\'ll realize it\\'s the same way I feel for you. Does that make any sense? KATE Yes. I mean, I\\'ve known you forever. It\\'s not an easy thing to figure out. WILL I don\\'t need an answer now. Just think about it. And no matter what you decide, you\\'re too good for assholes like Mark and the rest of them. Kate manages a small, stifled laugh. KATE Okay. I will process all of this. It\\'s just, the bomb - WILL It\\'s distracting. I know. Anyway, I\\'d love to stay and talk some more, but I can\\'t. I gotta ask you to leave now, because I\\'m running out of time. Kate nods. Will hangs up the phone. She turns back toward the access door, stops. She yells across the roof at Will - KATE If I had time to think about it...I\\'d probably tell you that I\\'ve always felt very strongly for you. And I\\'ve never thought of you as a brother. Will smiles, yells back - WILL That\\'s a huge relief. Don\\'t say anything else. I just really don\\'t want to die now. KATE Try not to. Please. Kate turns and continues to the access door. 61. INT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY Jay paces about the landing that leads up to the roof. He hears the door opening and hurries down to the entrance for the nearest floor. He tries the door, but it\\'s locked. Kate enters the stairwell from the roof access door and spots Jay trying to force the door open. She is holding back tears. He just looks incredibly confused. JAY I\\'m, uh...I\\'m a personal shopper. I\\'m looking for Mr. Quilby. KATE I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t know who that is. Kate continues down the stairs, tears coming now. Jay waits a beat, then hurries down and tries the door on the next level, which is open. INT. MINIVAN - DAY Jay jumps in the van, huffing and puffing. DWAYNE So? JAY It was just his girlfriend or something. DWAYNE Getting one last blow job in case he don\\'t make it. I kinda like this guy. INT. DATSUN - DAY Will, galvanized by the exchange, hops inside. CHET Did you tell her how you saw her naked when she was 13? That always works. WILL I said my piece. She\\'s gonna think about it. CHET Shut up. She was freaked out. WILL Yes. By the bomb. CHET By you. 62. WILL Would it be so bad if we ended up together? You and I would be family. CHET I don\\'t want you in the family. You bring very little to the table. I want her to be with someone awesome. A pro quarterback. A war hero. At the very least, someone I\\'ve never watched porn with. WILL Well, now it\\'s up to her. CHET Not if I set that bomb off myself. WILL Then you\\'d probably never get to rob a bank. Will throws the car into gear and pulls away. SUPER COUNTDOWN: 4 hours, 10 minutes... CUT TO: EXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY The Datsun is parked in the half-full lot. The guys lean against the driver side, with their backs to the bank and the car providing cover. They each have a spray painted air pistol tucked into their pants. WILL You go for the money. I\\'ll cover the crowd. In and out. Chet clasps his hands around his stomach. CHET I\\'m not feeling so good. I drank like three of those 5-Hour Energy drinks. WILL It\\'s just nerves. Let\\'s pull our shit together and do this thing. Chet reigns it in. The guys slide on the leather gloves and rolled up ski masks. They turn and stride toward the bank. The guys stop as they get to the door. They pull the ski masks down and take out their air pistols. 63. CHET What should I call you in there, like if I need to ask you to do something? WILL Call me Tivon. You\\'ll be Darius. CHET I can tell you\\'re not a black guy through the ski mask. WILL Fine. Then you\\'ll be Luis and I\\'m Cruz. We\\'re two loco motherfuckers and that\\'s the way we gotta roll when we get in there. INT. DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY It\\'s business as usual for a dozen CUSTOMERS and about as many EMPLOYEES. They all just want to get done with their shit and go home, when - Will and Chet burst through the bank doors, guns in hand. WILL Everybody put your hands in the air! CHET No, get on the ground! WILL Actually, listen to him and get on the fucking ground! Will and Chet are on an adrenaline high, waving their guns everywhere. People scream. WILL Shut up! Please! Will frantically scans the panicked crowd for - The SECURITY GUARD (40s), rail thin and jumpy. Will points his gun right at him. WILL You, just stand right there and don\\'t do shit! The rest of you get the fuck down! Spread your arms and legs! Why is no one listening to me!? SECURITY GUARD Just take it easy, man! 64. WILL Don\\'t be a hero, cowboy! SECURITY GUARD What the fuck does that mean? I\\'m not a hero! Or a cowboy! As people drop to the ground, whispering nervously to one ANOTHER - Chet rushes the TELLERS standing behind the bulletproof glass partition. CHET All of you, back away from the counter and get out here! Anyone pushes a button and one of these people gets totally shot! The Tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get onto their stomachs. Will looks to the Guard. WILL Very slowly, take out your gun and toss it away. The Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves it away. The gun slides across the waxed floor and - Right into the outstretched hand of a sobbing MOM (40s), whose DAUGHTER (11) lies beside her in a soccer uniform. MOM Oh, god! I don\\'t want the gun! WILL (TO GUARD) What the fuck!? Did you do that on purpose!? SECURITY GUARD It was an accident! CHET Are you guys working together? MOM No! Please take this gun away! WILL Just toss it, lady! 65. The Mom slides the gun away like it were on fire. It skids all the way across the floor, slams hard against a wall and BLAM! MAN\\'S VOICE (O.S.) Ah! A FAT MAN has been shot. He clutches his thigh. FAT MAN I think she got the femoral artery! MOM I\\'m sorry! It was an accident! FAT MAN Fuck you! Who slides a gun like that!? DAUGHTER Mommy, what\\'s happening!? MOM Christi, be quiet. These men are dangerous. Chet turns ashen. He moves close to Will, whispers urgently - CHET This is fucked. That dude is gonna bleed out and we\\'re gonna go to prison. WILL Just calm down. FAT MAN Why is no one getting me help!? WILL Is anyone here a doctor? Nothing. Just the heavy breathing of many frightened people. Will hurries over to the Fat Man, who is bent over, hugging his leg. WILL Sir, let me see where you\\'re hit. FAT MAN Just call me an ambulance! WILL Calm down, sir. 66. The Fat Man sits up, removes his hand from his leg. Will nervously takes a look. There is only a small amount of blood. WILL It\\'s just a flesh wound. You\\'re gonna be okay. FAT MAN But it hurts so bad. WILL You got shot, man. It\\'s not supposed to feel good. But you\\'re gonna be fine. And you\\'ll have a great story to tell everyone. FAT MAN This is an awful story! This isn\\'t a bank error in my favor! I got shot! WILL Point taken. Luis, how we doing on the money? Chet snaps back to attention - CHET Oh, shit. Sorry, Cruz. Chet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20- something girl, and helps her up off the ground. He checks her name tag: SANDRA. CHET Hey, Sandra. I know you\\'re probably scared right now, but if you go grab us 100 grand in a bag, we\\'ll get out of here. This will all be over and you\\'ll be fine. You trust me? Sandra nods. Chet smiles, reassuringly. She hurries behind the counter, starts filling a bank bag with cash, as - FAT MAN My leg really hurts! WILL Can you please hurry up, Sandra!? Sandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag. Will grabs it. He takes a last look at the people spread across the floor. 67. WILL I\\'m really sorry, everyone. I know we probably fucked up your day. (looks to Fat Man) I\\'m thinking of you in particular, sir. Actually, you know what... Will crosses to the Fat Man, offers the bank bag. WILL Quickly. Peel a few bills. On me. Anyone rats him to the cops and I\\'m coming for you. I remember faces. The Fat Man hesitantly reaches for the bag. Opens it - Red Dye explodes all over his face. He shrieks. Chet whirls on the teller. CHET What the fuck was that about, Sandra? I thought we had something going! What happened to trust? SANDRA I\\'m sorry! They make us do it! WILL Could you kindly fill another bag? Not a bank bag. A fucking garbage bag. And Luis, will you watch her this time? Sandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet. He dumps out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash. CHET Okay. That should be enough. Chet grabs the bag and hustles out toward Will. They are home free, until - They hear the wail of approaching sirens outside. They stop cold, panicked. Will whirls on the Tellers. WILL Fuck! Which one of you assholes tripped the alarm!? Was it you, Sandra!? SANDRA No! It was Mark! He pushed the button when you guys came in! Another teller, MARK, looks up from the floor. 68. MARK Sandra, you bitch! Now they\\'re gonna kill us both! SANDRA Fuck you, Mark! You\\'re the manager! Will loses his shit - WILL Fuck both of you! Fuck all of you! I\\'m a regular guy! Just like you! I\\'m a regular guy and you fucked me! Thank you for fucking a regular guy! People are freaked out. Sandra is crying, thinking she will probably get shot now. Chet grabs Will and pulls him toward the door. CHET Let\\'s just get the fuck out of here. The guys slam through the doors, out into EXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY Just as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot. Will and Chet make a run for it, but the cruiser cuts them off. OFFICER ZURMAN (21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the cruiser and levels his gun. The guys reflexively level theirs. OFFICER ZURMAN Drop your weapons! CHET Don\\'t shoot us! OFFICER ZURMAN Drop the guns or I\\'ll have to! Chet looks at Will with utter desperation. In the distance, they hear the sirens of more cops approaching. Will tosses his gun, rips open his jacket and grabs a cluster of wires. WILL Fuck you! You just brought a gun to a bomb fight, officer! I pull these wires out and we all go! You got ten seconds to drop your gun and - Zurman doesn\\'t stick around for the rest. He turns and sprints away. 69. As the guys make for the Datsun - CHET That was awesome. WILL He was tempting a desperate motherfucker. The guys jump in the Datsun and peel out as two more police cruisers race toward the bank. The cruisers change course and give chase. The Datsun blows right by the parked INT. MINIVAN - DAY Dwayne watches as the cars speed off into the distance. DWAYNE Holy shit! Our boy is causing some serious mayhem! JAY He\\'s gonna get caught or killed. Dwayne whirls on Jay, punches him hard in the shoulder. DWAYNE Shut the fuck up! If you jinx this with your negativity, I\\'m gonna strap a bomb to your chest next. Jay massages his shoulder, pissed. JAY Oh, yeah, who\\'s gonna build it? DWAYNE You are! EXT. STREET - DAY Whiplash blur as the three cars race by, one after the other. Airborne leaves flutter in their wake. INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING Chet freaks out as they hurtle toward lunchtime traffic. Will weaves in and out of cars. CHET Shit! This is not cool! Will is wild eyed, punching the gas. Chet\\'s head is on a swivel. Behind them: police cruisers in hot pursuit. Up ahead: the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by nothing but potential collisions that will result in a fiery death. 70. CHET Maybe we should pull over and surrender. WILL I can outrun these guys. They\\'re not the FBI, they\\'re local cops. Just shut up and let me concentrate. I do this for a living. As they clip the side-view mirror off a Kia - CHET You don\\'t do anything like this for a living! I am not a pizza, I am a man! The cruisers are gaining ground, throttles wide open. Will downshifts, spiking the RPMs into the red, as he banks a hard right and EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY The Datsun explodes onto a crowded street. PEDESTRIANS crossing an intersection jump out of its way. The cruisers take the turn into town. One makes it. The other slams into parked cars. INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING Will jumps the curb to avoid slow-moving traffic, slams into a newspaper dispenser. It flips up onto the hood and crashes into the windshield, where it stays lodged. WILL Holy fuck! Will veers back into the street and blindly plows ahead as cars he cannot see swerve to avoid him. He finally slams the brakes, the momentum knocking the dispenser loose and launching it onto the sidewalk, scattering Pedestrians. Chet whirls around to see the cruiser flying right at them. CHET Go! Go! Go! Will steps on the gas. The light ahead turns red. CHET Stop! Stop! Stop! 71. Will rolls the dice and blows through the intersection. He\\'s lucky. The cruiser behind him is not. It\\'s T-boned by traffic in a brutal, crunching collision. INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING The cruiser wreckage disappears in the rear-view mirror as Will floors it toward a green light. WILL That guy got fucked up. In the rushing moment as they cross the intersection, Chet glimpses the other cruiser barreling toward his side of the car from the perpendicular street. He has a millisecond, maybe, to process their impending doom, and then - The cruiser smashes into the back passenger side of the car. EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY The Datsun is sent spinning like a fucking top. Its ruined back wheel catches, sending the car tumbling onto its roof. INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING Madness. The guys scream as the car continues to slide, upside down, out of control. As it slams into a row of parking meters, the world goes BLACK Will blinks back to reality. He\\'s hanging, inverted, by his seat belt. The car is a pool of shattered glass. It twinkles up at him. Hours could have passed, but it\\'s only been seconds. He sucks in air. Satisfied that he is, in fact, still alive, he looks over at - A battered and bruised Chet, head drooping straight back. WILL Chet? Are you okay? Chet!? CHET (ROUSING) Oh my god... WILL Talk to me. CHET I thought you were gonna blow up. Will\\'s hands go to the bomb...still intact. 72. WILL No. Luckily your side took most of the impact. CHET Awesome. WILL We gotta keep moving. Will unclicks his seat belt and falls to the roof of the car. He moves to Chet, unclicks his belt and helps him down. EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY Will emerges from the overturned car. He drags Chet out, along with the bag of cash. He glances up to see the OFFICER who crashed into them stumbling out of his own ruined car, which has turned a fire hydrant into a geyser. Another cruiser races to the scene. WILL Oh, fuck, man. Come on. Will pulls Chet to his feet and they take off, rounding a CORNER INTO EXT. ALLEY - DAY As Will huffs and puffs - WILL Chet...I don\\'t know how to tell you this...but you got a piece of the car in you. CHET What!? WILL In your back. Chet glances back to see a jagged piece of metal sticking out of his shoulder blade. CHET Ah! Get it out! WILL I will. CHET Do it now! 73. WILL All right. Without breaking stride, Will yanks the piece of metal out of Chet\\'s back. He screams. CHET Is it rusty? Am I gonna get tetanus? Behind them, two Officers turn into the alley in full sprint. They are way faster than the guys and soon gain on them. Will can barely keep up with Chet. CHET Why are you moving so slowly? WILL It\\'s a combination of cheap sneakers and this heavy fucking bomb on my chest! They burst out of the alley, onto EXT. STREET - DAY The guys frantically search for an escape, spot - A bus pulling up to a stop down the street. They sprint for the the bus, peeling off their ski masks and waving as it lazily rolls away from the stop. WILL Hey! Over here! The bus slows and the guys trip over each other to board it. INT. BUS - DAY - MOVING The guys fall into seats, gasping for air, a complete mess. Will looks out the window to see the Officers emerge from the alley and look around for them. EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY A crowd has grown around the crash sites. Fire trucks and ambulances are on the scene. Dwayne and Jay make their way through the crowd, trying to see what\\'s what. Dwayne approaches a RANDOM LOCAL. DWAYNE You hear what happened to the guys they were after? 74. RANDOM LOCAL Sounds like they got away. Dwayne and Jay beam. EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY The guys are covered in sweat as they hike along, eyes on the lookout. They arrive at Will\\'s parked Mustang. Will hugs the car. WILL I never thought I\\'d see you again. CHET I thought you hated this car. WILL It\\'s actually not that bad. You know, as compared to that Datsun. The Mustang\\'s got more comfortable seats. And it never would have flipped over. INT. MUSTANG - DAY The guys get in. They sit there for a moment, silent except for their heavy breathing. Will\\'s eyes go to the garbage bag sitting between them. WILL There\\'s a 100 grand in there. 100 fucking grand. Which we stole. From a bank. CHET I told a bunch of people I was gonna shoot someone. I was like \"you fucking move, and I will kill you where you stand!\" WILL I threatened to blow up a cop. (BEAT) And you never said \"I will kill you where you stand.\" CHET I know. But shit did get pretty crazy. WILL Yeah, it did. Will starts to get a little emotional. 75. WILL You know, there\\'s no one I would have rather taken down a fucking bank with. I mean that. Chet smiles. CHET Me, neither. WILL And as for all that shit I said...and all that shit I did...I hope you can forgive me. We\\'ve been friends for so long, and I guess you hurt the people you\\'re closest to the most. CHET I messed up, too. I\\'m a dude who slept with his best friend\\'s ex- girlfriend, and destroyed his parents\\' marriage, and sat on the sidelines watching his downward spiral. I\\'m a shitty human being. But I\\'m glad you know that now, because you can accept me for who I am. WILL I do. I accept you. Because you accept me. Will goes in for a hug. Chet gets lost in the moment, before recoiling. CHET Woah! You still got a bomb on you. WILL You\\'re right. Let\\'s take care of that. But you owe me a hug. Will pulls the slip of paper Dwayne gave him from his pocket. WILL It\\'s all gravy from here. Will takes out his cell and dials the number. INTERCUT WITH: EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY Dwayne and Jay cross toward a McDonald\\'s. Dwayne stops and answers his vibrating cell phone. 76. DWAYNE This who I think it is? WILL (O.S.) Can\\'t you hear the ticking in the background? DWAYNE You know, you\\'re a pretty funny guy. WILL (O.S.) Thanks. I\\'m happy to entertain a complete psychopath. DWAYNE Now wait a second, you\\'re the murderer. WILL (O.S.) What\\'s that supposed to mean? DWAYNE One of those cops who wrecked his car chasing you...he ain\\'t breathing no more. Will goes white, covers the phone and whispers to Chet - WILL We killed a cop. CHET You were driving! I\\'m just an accomplice! WILL They\\'re gonna hunt us down and kill us. Cops don\\'t take this shit lightly. CHET I bet he had like eight kids. We have to find them and support his family forever. Dwayne is holding back laughter. Finally bursts out. WILL (O.S.) What\\'s so fucking funny!? DWAYNE I\\'m just messin\\' with you. You didn\\'t kill anyone. How\\'d a moron like you manage to rob a bank? WILL (O.S.) Jesus! Can we just get this over with? Where do you want the money? 77. DWAYNE There\\'s a boarded up gas station out on Commerce Avenue, past the highway. Be there in 30 minutes. WILL (O.S.) I\\'ll be there in ten. DWAYNE Then you\\'ll be standing around with your dick in one hand, and my money in the other. Dwayne hangs up. He dials another number - DWAYNE Yo, Juicy, wrangle your boy. Money\\'s on its way. EXT. ROAD - DAY The Mustang shrieks past us. SUPER COUNTDOWN: 2 hours, 58 minutes... CUT TO: INT. MCDONALD\\'S - DAY Dwayne and Jay sit at a table with a fast food feast spread out. Dwayne eats a Big Mac, a look of utter satisfaction on his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon. DWAYNE I remember the summer after my mother passed was the first year they had the Monopoly game at McDonald\\'s. I musta come here three times a day trying to collect all the game pieces. Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from all the grease. The Major said I was the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he ever laid eyes on. But I didn\\'t care, I just wanted to win the money and get the fuck out of there. So, one night, I followed this skinny register kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling on him, asking him where they were hiding the Park Place piece. The million dollar prize. But he didn\\'t know shit. A year later, The Major won the lotto. I asked him for a Sega Genesis. He bought me one of those paddles with the ball attached. 78. Dwayne goes for a fry, sees his carton is empty and grabs a handful of Jay\\'s. DWAYNE I\\'m not ashamed to admit that I\\'ve gone through some dark times since then. Depression. Addiction to a variety of shit, which I won\\'t go into. I know you must think that\\'s pretty silly, especially since you manage to get through the day and you don\\'t got shit going on as compared to me. But that\\'s just the way it is. That\\'s life. Jay looks pretty affected that Dwayne is opening up to him. JAY You know, I\\'ve been pretty low, too... if you ever want to talk about that kinda stuff. DWAYNE No. I don\\'t. My whole point I was trying to make before you interrupted me was that that shit is all in the past. \\'Cause I did it. I finally pulled it off. JAY We pulled it off, Dwayne. The two us. We\\'re a good team. DWAYNE Are we? Would you do anything to protect me, my money, my empire? JAY Yeah, sure... (NERVOUS) I mean, like what kinda stuff are we talking about? Dwayne takes out his cell, keys in the speed dial code and slides the cell across the table to Jay. DWAYNE Would you push the button? JAY Why would you want me to do that? DWAYNE It\\'s just a question, Jay. Would you? If I asked you? (MORE) 79. DWAYNE (CONT\\'D) I mean, it\\'s no different than those watermelons. JAY Watermelons aren\\'t alive. DWAYNE Yeah, they are. Not the ones you blew up, though. Dwayne stares hard at Jay. A tense beat. JAY No one gets hurt...right, Dwayne? DWAYNE Oh, yeah. I forgot about that part. Dwayne cracks a smile. DWAYNE Anyway, he hasn\\'t even made the drop yet. I\\'m gonna go take a shit. Stay away from the bathroom. Someone could get hurt. Dwayne heads off. Jay eyes the cell phone he has left behind. EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY Weeds have overtaken the abandoned place. Will leans against his parked car, waiting. Chet is nowhere to be seen. Will spots Vaughn\\'s Sentra approach. It pulls into the station and Vaughn steps. He could not look more menacing. Juicy hangs back in the passenger seat. WILL Where are the other guys? VAUGHN I\\'m the only guy. (BEAT) You got it? Will picks up the garbage bag at his feet and walks it over to Vaughn. He opens it, looks in. VAUGHN What the fuck did you do...rob a bank? 80. WILL (INCREDULOUS) Yes. Vaughn grins. WILL Now where\\'s the code? VAUGHN I don\\'t have any code. Vaughn turns to leave. Will grabs his arm. Vaughn stops, looks purposefully down at Will\\'s hand. Will draws back. WILL Listen, man, I just want the code. VAUGHN I don\\'t know what the fuck you\\'re talking about. WILL The code for the fucking bomb! Will opens his jacket. Vaughn takes a sudden step back. VAUGHN What kind of stupid motherfucker wears a bomb to a drop? WILL Your boss put this on me. VAUGHN I am my boss. WILL Then give me the code! VAUGHN Motherfucker, I don\\'t know no goddamn code. Whoever told you I did, lied to you. Now step the fuck off, or I\\'ll shoot you in the face so you don\\'t explode and mess up my boots. Vaughn goes to leave again. Will runs ahead of him and gets in his way. WILL If you don\\'t have the code, I want that money back. 81. VAUGHN The only way you\\'re getting this money back is if you kill me. WILL You don\\'t know what I\\'ve gone through for that money! In an instant, Vaughn has his gun out, aimed at Will\\'s head. VAUGHN Do I look sympathetic? Now step the fuck aside. INT. SENTRA - DAY Juicy looks on with interest as Vaughn holds Will at gunpoint. Then she spots EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY Chet creeping up behind Vaughn, from wherever he was hiding, clutching a large metal pipe. Juicy jumps out of the Sentra. JUICY Vaughn, look out! Vaughn whirls around toward Chet, just in time to have his gun arm smashed by the pipe. The weapon drops from his hand. Chet takes another swing, cracking Vaughn across the face. He howls, blood spraying, and topples over. Chet goes for another swing, when - Juicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing. Will grabs the back of Juicy\\'s track jacket for leverage and flings her away. She hits the back of the Sentra and careens clear across the trunk. WILL Let\\'s go! Will grabs the money. Chet kicks Vaughn\\'s gun into the bushes. The guys break for the Mustang and get in. Juicy gets to her feet, runs right by a dazed Vaughn and after the car, which pulls out into the road and leaves her behind, screaming and cursing. INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING Will\\'s mind is racing. 82. WILL What the fuck was that? CHET They tried to screw us. You\\'re a liability. They were just gonna let you blow up. WILL Not with the money they won\\'t. INT. JAY\\'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY A tidy space, filled with various half-finished devices, action figures and heavy metal posters. A low mechanical hum registers. Dwayne sits on a stool in the center of the garage, while Jay carefully trims his hair with an electric clipper. Dwayne holds up a mirror to check out his work. DWAYNE Never comes out this nice when I do it myself. You might wanna take some more off the top, though. I wanna look real professional when I go down to the morgue to identify the body. Dwayne\\'s phone chimes from a nearby counter. He grabs it, looks at the incoming number, slightly concerned. He answers - DWAYNE You drop the money yet? INTERCUT WITH: INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING Will yells into the phone - WILL No! I\\'ve still got the money! And I cracked your friend\\'s face open! DWAYNE (O.S.) Why the fuck would you do that!? WILL You lied! You said I\\'d get the code! Dwayne is panicked, covers badly - DWAYNE I gave him the code. He told me he committed it to memory. (MORE) 83. DWAYNE (CONT\\'D) He was probably just embarrassed that he forgot it. I\\'ll call him up and - WILL (O.S.) You didn\\'t give him shit! I want the code now or you\\'ll never see this money! DWAYNE Hold on there, big man. You got a bomb on you. I got a cell phone that detonates it. You\\'re not exactly negotiating from a position of leverage. WILL (O.S.) I\\'m holding the money. I blow up, and it blows up. Who has the leverage now? Go ahead and push the button, you idiot. Chet freaks out - CHET Don\\'t tell him to push the button! Pull over! Pull over! Dwayne is getting pissed off. DWAYNE Why don\\'t you watch what the fuck you say! I own you! I tell you to rob a bank, and you rob a bank. I tell you to give me the money, and you give me the goddamn money and hope I show you some mercy. WILL (O.S.) I\\'m tired of this bullshit. I\\'m already dead, right? So fuck you. At least I\\'ll die rich. I can\\'t say the same for you. The line goes dead. Dwayne tears off his haircut smock. DWAYNE That piece of shit hung up on me! INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING Chet grabs the wheel and forces Will to pull over. CHET Get me out of this car! 84. EXT. ROAD - DAY Chet jumps out while the Mustang is still slowing down. He runs 20 yards away. Will turns the car off and gets out. CHET That was colossally stupid! WILL It was a negotiation tactic. He\\'ll call back and I won\\'t answer. Then he\\'ll call back and I will answer, and he\\'ll realize the only way he gets the money is if he gives me the code. CHET Sure! That seems like a perfectly logical pattern of thought! I bet that\\'s exactly what he\\'ll do! INT. JAY\\'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY Dwayne tries Will\\'s phone again. It goes to voicemail. He explodes like a pack of Mentos in a two-liter of Diet Coke. Throws his cell across the room. Overturns a work table. DWAYNE Does this guy know who the fuck I am!? Jay retreats into a corner. Dwayne\\'s a big boy, and he soon tires himself out, hunches over, panting. JAY Dwayne...you never told me you weren\\'t going to give him the code. DWAYNE We\\'re not amateurs. He was a loose end. I let him live, someday I woulda been walking out of my mansion and... bam! FBI, CIA, NSA, all converging on my front lawn, \\'cause a loose end turned state\\'s evidence and they got what they need to put me away. Dwayne shakes his head. Starts digging through the mess he\\'s made...finds his phone. DWAYNE Fuck it, Jay. I\\'ll just kill The Major myself. Dwayne keys in the speed dial code. 85. JAY Don\\'t do it. Dwayne looks down at the send button. DWAYNE You know what they say about a tree falling in the forest? Maybe the same thing applies to blowing up some motherfucker across town. Maybe it doesn\\'t even make a sound. Dwayne hits send. DWAYNE Boom. But Dwayne notices something...the phone in his hand is ringing. He puts it to his ear. The line connects - FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Hello...who is this...hello...? Dwayne snaps the phone shut, looks to Jay, who tries to will the beads of sweat back into his pores. DWAYNE Who did I just call, Jay? \\'Cause she sounded cute for a bomb. JAY (SWALLOWS HARD) Gina Kim. My seventh grade crush. Or whoever lives in Gina Kim\\'s house now. DWAYNE Where\\'s the number for the bomb? JAY In my head. I switched it out of your phone while you were taking a shit. You\\'re out of control, Dwayne. DWAYNE I\\'m in perfect control! Dwayne charges Jay. Jay holds up the hair clippers like a weapon, flicks them on. Dwayne rips the cord out of the wall, uses it to yank the clippers from Jay\\'s hand, then whips him with the cord. JAY Stop it! 86. Dwayne goes to whip Jay again, but Jay moves like a jack rabbit and delivers a fierce kidney shot. Dwayne stumbles backward, falls onto the couch, groans - DWAYNE You asshole...I make you my partner and you pull this shit... JAY I\\'m tired of you pushing me around all the time! What kinda partner does that!? DWAYNE Fuck you...I\\'m gonna piss blood, aren\\'t I? JAY That\\'s what it said on the internet. Dwayne\\'s phone rings in his pocket. DWAYNE Go on. Get it out for me. I can barely move. Jay pulls the cell from Dwayne\\'s pocket...opens it and puts it to his ear so he can answer - DWAYNE Glad you came to your senses. INTERCUT WITH: EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY Vaughn has a rag pressed to his swollen, bloody face. Juicy is nearby, banged up and dirty. Vaughn yells into his cell - VAUGHN Who the fuck do you think you\\'re talking to!? DWAYNE (O.S.) I honestly don\\'t know. VAUGHN Let me give you a hint: your boy just jumped me, tossed my bitch like a rag doll and split with the cash. Dwayne realizes who\\'s on the other line, recovers - DWAYNE That guy\\'s not my boy. He\\'s a dick. I\\'m sorry for all the, uh, confusion. 87. VAUGHN (O.S.) Confusion? The only motherfucker that\\'s confused is you. Apparently, you think you can fuck me and survive the day. DWAYNE I wasn\\'t fucking you, I was fucking him. You gotta understand, you\\'re like a pawn in a much larger game I\\'m playing here. VAUGHN (O.S.) Did you just call me a pawn, you stupid fuck!? DWAYNE I didn\\'t mean it like that. I\\'m just juggling a whole lot of shit. VAUGHN (O.S.) I want my money. Right now. DWAYNE That may not be possible. (DELICATELY) I just want to put this out there, to keep you in the loop...but I may need to bump the hit. Vaughn paces, furious. VAUGHN This isn\\'t a reservation at Sizzler! You don\\'t \"bump\" it! I want you to bring me my money right now, to where I am standing in this shit hole town, bleeding from the motherfucking face! DWAYNE (O.S.) I don\\'t exactly have the money...give me some time and - VAUGHN The deal\\'s off! You just became the hit! Vaughn hangs up, tosses the bloody rag to the ground and screams in frustration. JUICY He lives with his daddy. You already got the address. 88. INT. JAY\\'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY Dwayne looks down at his phone. DWAYNE That\\'s it. The assassin\\'s gonna kill me now. I\\'m gonna die. Game fucking over. Dwayne cradles his arms around his wounded kidney, rocks back and forth, wallowing in defeat. JAY We can still get him the money. Try the pizza guy back. DWAYNE Why? So he can fuck around again, and I wind up dead, anyway? No. I\\'d rather just sit here. I want to die right here on this couch. JAY No. We\\'re gonna get that money. Just like we planned. All we gotta do is get the leverage back. DWAYNE How do we do that? Pizza boy\\'s obviously got some kinda death wish. Jay gathers his resolve. JAY We take the girl. The one he went to see. Then he won\\'t try shit. Dwayne looks up at Jay with something not unlike awe. DWAYNE That\\'s actually...that\\'s a great fucking idea, Jay. It\\'s the best idea anyone\\'s had all day. Dwayne lowers his head. He removes the gun from his belt...holds it out to Jay. Jay takes it. Feels its weight. Then offers it back. JAY I was just trying to figure out how you would do it, Dwayne. Dwayne takes the gun. Struggles to stand. Jay helps him. 89. DWAYNE Ok. Then let\\'s do it right. We leave nothing to chance. Because if we go to prison for this, I won\\'t be able to watch out for you. JAY Ok, Dwayne. Dwayne looks over at a frame backpack hanging from a hook on the wall. PVC piping bulges from it. DWAYNE You should probably bring the flamethrower, buddy. There\\'s gonna be some evidence to dispose of. EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY Will and Chet sit on the ground, still 20 yards apart. Chet checks his watch. CHET It\\'s been half an hour. WILL He\\'ll call. CHET In another 30 minutes I\\'m calling the bomb squad. Chet gestures to the vast emptiness all around them. CHET These guys obviously aren\\'t watching you anymore. WILL You know, even if they get the bomb squad here in time, and they can somehow get this thing off me, we still gotta answer for the robbery. CHET I\\'ll take the heat with you, Will. WILL Nah. I\\'ll tell them I forced you into it. That you didn\\'t have a choice. CHET Thanks, man. 90. Will looks at Chet for a beat. WILL That\\'s it? You\\'re not gonna think about it a little longer? After all we went through...tear down the relationship, rebuild it...you\\'re gonna let me go to prison alone? CHET You offered. WILL It was a test. Your grade: F minus. You know what the \"F\" is for? CHET To fuck myself? WILL You passed that test. Failed the important one. As the guys continue to argue - SUPER COUNTDOWN: 1 hour, 28 minutes... CUT TO: INT. LAW FIRM, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY Kate walks down a hallway, turns into an office. Two figures rush past from the intersecting hallway and duck behind a corner. Kate emerges from the office and continues into INT. WOMEN\\'S BATHROOM, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY Kate goes to the mirror, checks herself out. She\\'s been crying. She splashes water on her face, then enters a stall. The bathroom door opens and Dwayne and Jay enter. Dwayne pulls something hairy from his pocket. Inside the stall, Kate reaches for some toilet paper...from underneath the barrier, she notices two pairs of dirty, masculine sneakers. Her breath goes shallow. She takes out her cell, quietly opens it. She presses the first 9 in \"911,\" but her keypad volume is on and the phone makes a dull, electronic beep that echoes in the quiet bathroom. DWAYNE (O.S.) Why don\\'t you just slide the phone under the door, so I don\\'t have to kick it open and see you with your panties down. 91. Kate slides the phone out. One of the sneakers crushes it. She gets off the toilet, arranges her clothing and steps out out of the stall. She gasps at - The two ominous men standing there in gorilla masks. Dwayne\\'s gun is plainly visible, tucked into the front of his pants. DWAYNE What\\'s the quietest way out of the building? \\'Cause I might get excited in a confrontation, and you might wind up shot in the face. EXT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY The Major is watching reruns of Three\\'s Company. He doesn\\'t laugh or remotely smile at any of it. The subtle click of a door opening does not escape his finely tuned senses. MAJOR Dwayne? Nothing. The Major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through a drawer and pulls something out. A simple pen. He clutches it like a weapon. INT. HALLWAY, NICE HOUSE - DAY The Major creeps along. VAUGHN (O.S.) Just stay where you are, old man. The Major turns to find Vaughn pointing a gun at him. VAUGHN I\\'m looking for your son. MAJOR Even if I knew where he was, I wouldn\\'t tell you nothing. VAUGHN Don\\'t be stupid. MAJOR You know, I saved a black man\\'s life in the shit. So if I took yours I\\'d be even. VAUGHN I see where your son gets his common sense. (MORE) 92. VAUGHN (CONT\\'D) But you might want to readjust your attitude, because I ain\\'t fucking around. I want Dwayne. I don\\'t know why you\\'d want to protect him, the motherfucker hired me to kill you. If this news has any effect at all on The Major, he doesn\\'t show it. VAUGHN Just tell me where he is! Vaughn pulls back the hammer of his gun. MAJOR You think I\\'m scared of death? There\\'s a whole generation of gooks that think I\\'m the grim reaper. Vaughn shakes his head. Almost imperceptibly, The Major repositions the hand with the pen in it. Vaughn is about to squeeze the trigger - But The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is actually a pen gun. It fires a .22 caliber round into Vaughn\\'s neck. He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood. The Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck. MAJOR I\\'ll ride you all the way to hell! I know exactly how to get there! Vaughn reaches for his gun. His fingers curl around it and he whips it across The Major\\'s face, knocking him backwards. Vaughn scrambles to his feet, gun pointed at the felled Major. VAUGHN What now, old man!? You can\\'t kill me! None of y\\'all can kill me! The Major looks up at Vaughn, once again face to face with a loaded weapon. MAJOR Go on and - BANG! The Major goes limp, one searing hole in his chest. 93. Vaughn clasps a hand to his neck to staunch the flow of blood. He steps over the The Major\\'s body and continues upstairs. INT. BATHROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY Vaughn rifles through the cabinets, dumps all of the first aid supplies into the sink. He gets to work on his wound. INT. DWAYNE\\'S ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY The locked door is kicked open. Vaughn, neck crudely bandaged, flicks on the lights and looks around the childish room. Chinese Fighting Fish swim in a large tank, seem to stop and look out at him like guard dogs. Vaughn ransacks the place. He finds a desk drawer locked. Takes out his gun and blows it open. Vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer. Flips through it. It\\'s full of details about Dwayne\\'s plan, the tanning salon, etc. VAUGHN Motherfucker has lost his mind... He finds a map of the town in the file. Three locations are highlighted: the bank, the boarded up gas station, and the radio tower. PUSH IN on the radio tower. Vaughn stuffs the map into his pocket. He stops before leaving the room, turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of his gun. Water spills out and the Chinese Fighting Fish flop onto the floor. As Vaughn lifts a boot to stomp them - EXT. ROAD - DAY Will and Chet are still arguing - CHET Look at the upshot, while you\\'re behind bars you can finally finish your degree. If I was there, too, it would just be a distraction. WILL Great idea, Chet. Thanks a lot. I\\'ll just sit here and figure out a fucking major. Will stews. After a beat, his hand goes to his pocket. It\\'s vibrating. He pulls out his cell. WILL Hey, it\\'s them. 94. Will answers - WILL You ready to talk now? INTERCUT WITH: INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING Dwayne drives with his cell pressed to his ear. Jay keeps watch on Kate in back. She is blindfolded, hands bound behind her back with duct tape. DWAYNE (INTO PHONE) Yeah, I\\'m ready to talk. I want my money. Meet me back at the radio tower in 50 minutes. WILL (O.S.) I\\'ve barely got an hour left! DWAYNE That\\'s the point. I want you on a short leash. WILL (O.S.) Fuck that. Give me the code first. Then you can have your money. You\\'ll just have to trust me when I say that I don\\'t want it. DWAYNE Yeah, I\\'m sure. You just wanna go back to your fantastic life. Your great job. And that blonde bitch with the sexy voice. Will\\'s mind jumps to the only logical conclusion. Roller coaster stomach drop. His voice cracks as he asks a useless QUESTION - WILL What the fuck is that supposed to mean? DWAYNE (O.S.) It means that girl you paid a visit to today is sitting in the back of my van right now. And it ain\\'t exactly consensual. WILL Fuck you! You crossed a line! 95. Dwayne just laughs, maniacally. DWAYNE There are no lines! There\\'s just me and you and 100 thousand dollars. Once we get that shit in order, you can have her back, and your life, too. So you\\'re gonna show up where I say, when I say. Alone. And if you try anything stupid, the two of you will be delivering pizzas to Saint Peter. WILL Let me talk to her. DWAYNE You got ten seconds. Dwayne hands the phone back to Jay, who puts it to Kate\\'s ear. She is trembling. KATE Will...? WILL (O.S.) Kate, I\\'m so sorry. KATE It\\'s okay...I\\'m fine...I\\'m just really - Dwayne snatches the phone. DWAYNE She\\'s just really gonna die if you fuck this up. Will absorbs this like a blow to the chest. The line disconnects. WILL Fuck! CHET What happened? WILL They have Kate. CHET What the fuck does that mean!? WILL They took her, man. They must have followed us to her office. 96. CHET Damn it! You had to go see her! WILL I\\'m sorry. I messed up...I finally messed up worse than I could have possibly imagined. CHET We gotta get her back, Will. These guys are crazy. WILL We still got the money. As long as we have that, she\\'s alive. Come on. Chet grabs the bag of cash. They hustle into the car and it peels out, leaving behind a swirling cloud of dust. As the sun begins to set - SUPER COUNTDOWN: 58 minutes... CUT TO: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT Two menacing headlights come at us on the empty road. They BELONG TO INT. SENTRA - NIGHT - MOVING Vaughn holds up Dwayne\\'s map as he drives. He seems to be on the right road, headed for the radio tower. He crumples the map and throws it in back. EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT The Mustang stops by the gate to the radio tower. Chet jumps out and disappears into the bushes. EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT The Mustang pulls up. Will gets out and looks around the deserted place. He holds up the money bag. WILL I\\'m here! In the shadow of the nearby shed, the minivan is revealed as its interior lights come on. The door opens and Dwayne emerges, in his mask. DWAYNE How much time you got left? 97. Will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground. He looks at the timer. WILL Ten minutes. DWAYNE Damn. Maybe we should just wait around for the money shot. The guys meet in a clearing. Dwayne nods at the bag. DWAYNE That the money? WILL Maybe. Where\\'s the girl? Dwayne grins. DWAYNE In the van. Maybe. WILL Get her out here. You\\'re wasting time. Will grips the bag close to him. Dwayne whistles. The minivan door opens and Jay steps out. Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop. A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe- like device in his hand. Jay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van. They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him. KATE Will, are you there? WILL I\\'m here. It\\'s gonna be okay. DWAYNE This is a fucking tearjerker. WILL Just let her come over here. DWAYNE I will. But you should know, my associate over there is packing a flamethrower. Jay aims the metal device he has been holding. He hits a button and a pilot light comes on. 98. JAY (FLAT) Just do what we say. Don\\'t mess around or anything. DWAYNE Unless either of you can outrun a 25- foot flame. (gestures to gun in his belt) Or a bullet. Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her forward. Will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes her behind him. WILL Get back. DWAYNE I gave you the girl. Now give me the money. WILL How about we get the code out of the way first, since this bomb happens to be ticking so close to all of us. DWAYNE Fair enough. Dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket. DWAYNE (TAUNTING) You ready to be a free man? WILL Just give it to me! DWAYNE 448921. Will keys in the numbers. The timer freezes and the lock at the hinge opens. Will carefully extricates himself from the vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it. His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat. Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles. Jay takes a peak. DWAYNE It\\'s so fucking pretty, ain\\'t it? JAY Yeah. It\\'s awesome. 99. Dwayne looks up at Will. DWAYNE Okay, you can get out of here now. WILL I actually have this sneaking suspicion that once we turn around, you\\'re gonna put a bullet in both of our backs - and this is just a guess - burn our bodies. DWAYNE They say great minds think alike. And in this case, so do we. WILL I figured as much. That\\'s why I got a gun pointed at you, too. (LOUDLY) I got a sniper in the bushes locked on you right now. DWAYNE Do I look that dumb? WILL I can\\'t tell, you\\'re wearing a mask. Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something shining in his eyes. JAY Hey...on your forehead. Dwayne\\'s eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red dot that dances on his forehead. DWAYNE Son of a bitch. Well played. In the bushes, hidden from sight, Chet carefully aims his laser pointer at Dwayne\\'s forehead. Will grins at Dwayne. WILL We\\'re gonna walk out of here now. If you shoot, my sniper shoots. I can\\'t guarantee he\\'ll get both of you. But he\\'ll definitely get you. As Will turns away - 100. VAUGHN (O.S.) Hold the fuck up. Vaughn emerges from the darkness. He looks at Will. VAUGHN Wasn\\'t expecting to see you here. Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the butt of his gun. He goes down hard. Kate screams. Vaughn points the gun at her and she shuts up. Dwayne steps forward with the bag. DWAYNE It\\'s all good. We got your money. VAUGHN Nice mask, Dwayne. Now throw the money over here. Dwayne complies. As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the gun at him. DWAYNE Hold up. You don\\'t have to do this. I just paid you. Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side. Vaughn\\'s eyes burn a hole through Dwayne. VAUGHN I\\'ve been hit with a pipe, shot with a pen, and wasted my whole motherfucking day...all because of you and this job. DWAYNE I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. Just take the money. VAUGHN I will. And then I\\'m gonna tie up the two loose ends in the gorilla masks. DWAYNE I\\'m not a loose end! VAUGHN You\\'re a fucking idiot. You are as loose as ends get. Panicked, Dwayne\\'s eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his grip on the flamethrower handle. Jay catches Dwayne\\'s eye. Dwayne nods. Vaughn sees this. 101. VAUGHN What the - Jay rears up with the flamethrower. Vaughn couldn\\'t be more surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive ball of fire at him. Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of WHICH - Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and knocking him off his feet. Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate\\'s shoulder and she whirls around to find - KATE Chet!? What are you doing here!? CHET Not now. We gotta take off. (LOOKS AROUND) Where\\'s Will? Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was. Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot - Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay\\'s side. Bad news: it keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack, which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to have an incredibly low flash point. So the spark from, say, a bullet, would cause AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the garbage bag. WILL I got the money. Let\\'s get the fuck out of here. They take off toward Will\\'s car. Dwayne groggily comes to...no SOUND, just a ringing. The first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows- what spewing from his mouth. Vaughn levels his gun - It doesn\\'t make a sound for two reasons. The second being that it\\'s out of bullets. Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash. 102. Vaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him. SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay\\'s screams. Dwayne looks over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and shrieking. Dwayne\\'s head snaps to the other side, where he sees the Mustang\\'s tires peel. He tears off his mask, frantically looks around. The money is gone. DWAYNE No!! Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy, he somehow manages to string together two coherent words - JAY Dwayne! Help! Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne\\'s face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take? DWAYNE Goddamn it, Jay! Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it to beat the flames down. DWAYNE Stop, drop and roll! Jay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames, finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and smothers the last of them out. Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes. JAY You came back for me...you said you never would. DWAYNE You didn\\'t hesitate back there, Jay. You did good. Jay smiles. Flames overtake the field all around them. DWAYNE I\\'m gonna go put a bullet in that motherfucker and get our money. Think you can get outta here? JAY Yeah. Go get him. 103. Dwayne hurries toward the minivan. Jay stumbles up to his feet and limps off toward the woods. EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT The Mustang travels away from the rising flames. INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING Will\\'s face is a mess of dirt, sweat and dried blood. He and Chet stare ahead, completely shell-shocked. Kate looks from one of them to the other. KATE Uh...I just got kidnapped. CHET Yeah, that was totally Will\\'s fault. In case you want to factor that in while you\\'re mulling over the whole relationship thing. WILL I\\'m very sorry about the kidnapping. This is me, taking responsibility for it. Growing up. Like a viable life partner. CHET This man has spied on you in the nude before! WILL What? No, I didn\\'t. CHET He\\'s lying. He\\'s trying to build a relationship on a foundation of lies. And it won\\'t stand. KATE I just got kidnapped! Can we talk about that!? Something catches Will\\'s attention: a set of headlights rapidly growing larger in the rear-view mirror. INT. MINIVAN - NIGHT - MOVING Dwayne\\'s speedometer is buried past 100 mph. His eyes burn with intensity. 104. INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING Will hits the gas. WILL Oh, shit. One of those dudes is definitely not dead! Chet and Kate look out the back window. Chet screams - CHET Hurry up! He\\'s already on us! EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT Dwayne\\'s car pulls even with the Mustang. INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING Will looks over at Dwayne, who pulls out his gun and takes aim. He flashes a sick grin - DWAYNE I own this town. Before Dwayne can get a shot off - EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT An explosion rocks the minivan from inside. The back end is lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself. It lands on its roof and skids into a ditch. INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING Chet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back window. They are equal parts confused and happy to be alive. KATE What the hell was that? WILL That was the bomb I carried around all day. I reactivated it and put it in the back of his van. I guess his time was up. CHET \"His time was up?\" Were you thinking that up the whole day? WILL I was prepared, yes. I can\\'t help it if I\\'m the kind of guy who thinks about the future. 105. CHET (TO KATE) He\\'s not that kind of guy. He doesn\\'t think about the future. Ever. KATE What exactly happened since I saw you this afternoon? WILL Primarily, we robbed a bank. KATE What!? So you\\'re, like, fugitives? What do we do now? CHET Yeah, Will. What does the future hold? WILL Nothing good if we stay in town and they pin this on us. Kate, I think you should put in for that vacation time. Right now. If anyone gives you a problem, tell them to fuck off. There\\'s 100 grand in that trash bag by your feet. A third of it\\'s yours. Kate opens the bag...smiles through the dirt and grime. KATE Will, that\\'s - CHET Fucked up. Why does she get a share? WILL Why do you get a share? Chet stews. Will catches Kate\\'s eyes in the rear-view. WILL Airport\\'s 30 minutes away. Pick a destination. This time it\\'s not a practice run. EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY The car zooms off. SUPER COUNTDOWN: 0 hours, 0 minutes... CUT TO: 106. EXT. DITCH - NIGHT Wind fans the flames of the burning minivan. The shattered windshield sprouts another crack...then another, as - Dwayne\\'s foot kicks it out. He drags himself from the smoldering steel carcass. He is a charred, blood splattered mess, but he is alive. EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT Dwayne is propped up against a sign, lingering on the edge of consciousness. The headlights of a lone pickup truck approach. Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride. INT. NICE HOUSE - NIGHT The door opens and Dwayne stumbles through. He has made it home. He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut. From where his head has landed on the floor, Dwayne sees something odd...long red streaks. He crawls forward on all fours to investigate... It is a trail of sticky red blood. Dwayne follows it until he comes upon its source...the crumpled body of his father, lying face down. Dwayne\\'s face: shock and confusion and joy. DWAYNE Dad? Dwayne inches closer, pokes the body. Nothing. DWAYNE Dad, are you - The body emits a low groan. Dwayne rolls it over. His father\\'s face is white, he\\'s lost a lot of blood, but he isn\\'t totally spent yet. He struggles to speak - MAJOR Dwayne... DWAYNE What happened to you? MAJOR Some guy...said you hired him to kill me. DWAYNE Dad, I...I\\'d never... 107. MAJOR Look at you...lip quivering like you\\'re getting fucked...be a man. DWAYNE I am a man! I killed you, didn\\'t I? Now I\\'m gonna use your money to open a tanning salon where they let you fuck the chicks. This stirs something in The Major. MAJOR You mean...like those whorehouses...in \\'Nam...I used to tell you about? Dwayne softens at the recollection. DWAYNE Those were great bedtime stories. The Major nods. Opens his hand. Reveals a cordless phone. Dwayne looks to the bloody streaks down the hall, leading to the phone table. The Major dragged himself the whole way. MAJOR Medics are late...probably a couple lazy spicks...you tell \\'em I said so...all right, son? DWAYNE Sure thing, pop. The Major looks up at Dwayne\\'s bruised face, as if for the first time. MAJOR Hell of thing...I think I may...actually respect you now. Dwayne\\'s eyes well up. He reaches out, cradles his father as he expires. It\\'s like a very bloody, white trash version of the Pietà. Dwayne sobs uncontrollably, until - He drops his father and pound-pound-pounds his chest in some approximation of a life saving resuscitation. DWAYNE Get up, you pussy! Come on, soldier! PULL AWAY as Dwayne pounds the body and distant sirens grow nearer. FADE OUT: 108. BLACK. THE DARKNESS RIPPLES... Into waves. It\\'s the ocean, long past sunset. PULL BACK to find a lone figure staring out at it, sitting on EXT. BEACH - NIGHT Will. Shirtless. Could be anywhere. Chet approaches and sits beside him. CHET Fucking nine dollars to use the internet. WILL And? CHET Police think it was that black guy. They found some kind of map in his car. And I\\'m sure racial profiling played a part. WILL But nothing about us? CHET Nope. Guess it\\'s time to head back. WILL I was thinking we\\'d stick around a little a longer. CHET Why? So you have more time to delude my sister? WILL Yes. And it\\'d be easier if you gave us five fucking minutes alone. Chet stares out at the ocean for a beat. CHET You really think she\\'s into you? WILL (SWALLOWS HARD) I kissed her last night. No tongue. Then you walked in. Chet just nods. Will gets up. 109. CHET You\\'re gonna go fuck my sister now, aren\\'t you? WILL I\\'ll be thinking of you the whole time. CHET At the very least...be a considerate lover. Give pleasure, before taking pleasure. WILL I think I\\'m reading you. And I will try my best. Will heads up a trail that leads to a hotel bungalow. Kate opens the door, steps out onto the porch. Will stops, looks back at Chet. He whistles. Chet turns. WILL You\\'re Riggs! You always have been! Chet smiles, shakes his head as - Will reaches the porch. He stands close to Kate. His nerves clock overtime. WILL I lied and told your brother I kissed you. I thought it would make this easier. KATE Here\\'s an idea: pretend you have a bomb strapped to your chest. Tick, TICK - Will closes the gap and kisses her. After a beat - KATE Is Chet watching us? WILL Probably. We should go inside. I promised him I\\'d satisfy you. Kate laughs, leads him inside and the door shuts to - BLACK 110. CREDITS ROLL. But they are pushed to one side of the screen, as the other side is filled with - A lo-fi, 2001-style light tunnel. It deposits us in the furthest reaches of the galaxy, where we find - A tanning bed. Rotating in orbit. Dwayne\\'s voice booms and REVERBERATES - DWAYNE GRAND OPENING SPECTACULARRR! The tanning bed explodes, like a star gone supernova. From the light and fire and chaos...emerges a logo: MAJOR TAN A bad MATCH CUT takes us to the same logo. Camera ZOOMS OUT unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall storefront. We are watching a local commercial with appropriately poor production value. INT. MAJOR TAN - DAY (LOCAL COMMERCIAL) Dwayne walks backward down a hallway while addressing camera and trying not to trip - DWAYNE Here at Major Tan, our specially trained technicians are hard at work developing new technologies that harness the power of the sun, to ensure a cutting-edge tanning experience. Dwayne enters a tanning room. A man in a lab coat stares down at a clipboard, on which a complicated scientific equation is written. DWAYNE How\\'s it looking? The man turns: it\\'s Jay. His smiling face is speckled with healing burn wounds. JAY It\\'s our most advanced tanning bed yet! He gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed. 111. DWAYNE Hey, don\\'t just take this scientist\\'s word for it. The proof... Dwayne snaps his fingers. A BAD SPECIAL EFFECT makes him disappear, then reappear with a totally orange tan. DWAYNE ...is in the tan. We follow Dwayne back out into the hallway. DWAYNE But Major Tan isn\\'t just about looking good. It\\'s also about feeling good. Dwayne gestures to another room. The door opens and Juicy saunters out in a bikini. A beat later, a RANDOM GUY exits. RANDOM GUY That \"Deluxe Tan\" was fantastic! EXT. MAJOR TAN - DAY (LOCAL COMMERCIAL) Dwayne stands outside the store. DWAYNE So come on down to Major Tan...where we\\'re proud to be a family business. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...The Major beside Dwayne. He\\'s only about four feet tall now, on account of the wheelchair. But he\\'s grinning like a jackal, in a POW-MIA cap. A SUPERED LOGO appears: Military Discounts Available! As father and son smile and wave at us - END COMMERCIAL.',\n",

       "       'PHONE BOOTH by Larry Cohen FADE IN: NEW YORK CITY - AERIAL VIEW OF DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY MULTIPLE STREET SCENES - DAY The sidewalks crowded as usual. A sea of humanity. People come and go -- always in a hurry. Oblivious of one another. A TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction workers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS PEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a passerby. Intimidating. Demanding. Almost mocking. We\\'re surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we\\'ve come to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound. MULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East Side and West Side -- uptown and down. One frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he takes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters into a dozen pieces. NARRATOR There are 237,911 pay telephones in the five burroughs of the city of New York. Many of them are still in working order. DOZENS OF QUICK CUTS -- NEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up. We don\\'t hear the words. Only the facial expressions inform us that these are human beings under tremendous pressure. Life in the city is wearing them down. MULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS Lips jabbering into receivers. Cross-cut against one another. NARRATOR Despite increased usage of cellular devices, an estimated four and a half million New Yorkers and two million visitors still utilize pay telephones on a regular basis. At thirty-five cents a pop... for the first three minutes. ANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY There\\'s a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the street. NARRATOR You\\'re looking at the telephone booth at the corner of 45th Street and 8th Avenue in the heart of the Manhattan theatrical district. It has been scheduled to be removed and replaced by a kiosk. It\\'s one of the few remaining phone booths left in the city. CAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in appearance. WOMAN IN BOOTH (into receiver) You have lied to me for the last time, you lowlife prick bastard! I don\\'t ever want to hear the sound of your fucking voice again. (listens) Yes, well fuck you, too! She slams down the receiver and exits. The booth remains vacant for a brief interval. NARRATOR At least three hundred calls daily originate from this booth. The coins are collected twice a day. This booth has been burglarized forty-one times in the last six months. Someone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for coins. This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair styled and his nails manicured. Here is a man who clearly takes excellent care of himself. He sports a Donna Karen suit and silk Armani tie. He\\'s about to step into the booth when he\\'s accosted by a middle-aged man in a soiled apron who\\'s run out of a nearby restaurant and has finally caught up with him. MARIO Stu, we got to talk. STU Wish I could accommodate you, Mario, but this is my busy time of day. MARIO How come you cross the street every time you go past the restaurant? STU Why don\\'t I stop in later for some lunch? MARIO There\\'s no more drinks or free meals until the restaurant starts showing up in the columns like you said. STU I\\'m doing my level best for you people. MARIO One lousy mention in the Post and you expect to eat for six months! STU I got the food critic from the Village Voice all lined up to give you a review. MARIO That\\'s what you tell me last July. And he never shows. STU I was allowing you time to expand the menu. Wallpaper the bathrooms, for God sakes. You get only one shot with these fucking critics and I don\\'t want you to blow a rare opportunity. MARIO You the one blowing it. How long you think you can fuck everybody? STU Hold on right there. I\\'ve got a very excellent reputation around this town. MARIO So how come you take two nice suits of clothes from Harry and never get his daughter on David Letterman? STU Hell, I\\'m not an agent. I\\'m a publicist. MARIO Mister, you\\'re nothing! STU Believe me, Valerie\\'s on the waiting list to audition. Harry\\'s got no complaints. He just let me pick out this tie the other day. MARIO That Harry\\'s a damn fool! STU Mario, please let me make this up to you. How about I arrange for the opening night party for this new off-Broadway show I\\'m handling -- to be held at your place with local TV coverage on nine and eleven? I mean I had it promised to another client -- who actually pays me money. But it isn\\'t firmed up yet. And I could throw it your way. Maybe. MARIO What is involved? STU You\\'d toss in the buffet for say seventy or eighty. The producers would supply their own vino, of course. I\\'d deliver you a truckload of celebrities. And if they like the food, they\\'ll all come back, naturally. MARIO What celebrities? STU You want Liza Minelli? An Oscar winner. Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.? MARIO Is he still alive? STU I saw him last night going into the Four Seasons. I\\'ll bring you over a whole VIP list when we come by for dinner. MARIO How come everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to pay? STU You can\\'t think small like that. Hey, you still feature musicians Fridays and Saturdays? MARIO At least they work for their meals. STU What about Harry\\'s daughter as an extra added attraction? She\\'ll belt out five or six showtunes -- two sets a night -- and it won\\'t cost you a fucking nickel. MARIO How come? STU Star Showcase! Let me handle setting that up. And when she eventually goes on Letterman, she\\'ll announce I\\'m currently appearing over at Mario\\'s fine supper club. Right over CBS she\\'ll say that, Mario. MARIO You\\'re full of shit. You know that? All bullshit! STU That\\'s just a vulgar word for PR. (placing an arm around him) Mario, you can\\'t hurt my feelings. Even when I was a kid and they hurled certain invectives my way, it never bothered me. Other kids would fall apart if anybody called them a fucking name. Me, I just loved the attention! \\'Shit-for- brains\\' -- that\\'s what the bigger kids named me. And I answered to it. Hey, \\'shit-for brains\\' reporting for duty. Everybody loved me for that. I could take abuse. After a while, I kind of wore them down. There was nothing more they could say to me. So they stopped. I kind of missed it. MARIO I\\'m sorry I even talked to you. STU I\\'ll bet your loving wife put you up to this. She saw me pass by and she sent you out in the street. But I don\\'t hold it against you personally -- you still serve up superior veal chop. (entering phone booth) Now I got urgent business to conduct, Mario. He slides the booth closed in Mario\\'s face. The frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass before giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he goes up the block. INSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and dials. STU Hello, Mavis, sweet creature. MAVIS\\' VOICE Where have you been? Do you think I have nothing to do but wait around for you to call? STU I\\'m only a few minutes late, loveliest individual on earth. MAVIS\\' VOICE Stu, I\\'m so lonely. When can I see you? STU Good news in that arena. Kelly goes into rehearsal as of Monday. You know how dedicated she is. By the time she gets back from dancing her ass off, she goes right to sleep. We\\'ll have both our days and certain nights. Not to mention when they take the show on the road. MAVIS\\' VOICE How long is that for? STU Four to five weeks -- minimum. MAVIS\\' VOICE Maybe I should quit my job so we can be together full time. STU I wouldn\\'t do that. MAVIS\\' VOICE Sometimes I think if I have to give one more fucking manicure... STU That\\'s how you met me. MAVIS\\' VOICE I never saw a worse set of nails. Bit right down to the quick. STU I\\'m much better groomed since you\\'ve been looking after me. MAVIS\\' VOICE I\\'m glad you admit it. STU Even Kelly remarked on it when I first met her. MAVIS\\' VOICE She could care less how you look. She\\'s only interested in pushing her own career. Some wife you\\'re stuck with! STU The marriage is not without its compensations. Do you imagine I could afford that apartment on what I\\'m earning? Not with everybody cutting back on the publicity. Not to mention a million college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out. And one thing you can\\'t expect from your clients is loyalty. They get a couple of bad notices, they dump you. Goodbye. MAVIS\\' VOICE Don\\'t go. STU I wasn\\'t saying goodbye to you. I was saying how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a month\\'s notice. A conservative businessman now stands outside the booth waiting to use it. He deliberately glances at his watch a few times to demonstrate his impatience. This bothers Stu who slides the booth open a crack. STU (yelling) What? Is your watch busted? It\\'s twenty after eleven and I\\'m gonna be occupied indefinitely with my transaction. So get out of my face! He closes the booth up again and turns his back to the gentleman who gives up and departs. STU Sorry, honey. There will be no further interruption. MAVIS\\' VOICE Why must you always be calling me from some booth? STU On account of that phone records are regularly subpoenaed in divorce proceedings. And I don\\'t want some entry showing up on my cellular bill either. She gets the mail. She looks these items over. Sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is. MAVIS\\' VOICE Then she suspects something. STU It\\'s only because her last husband, the choreographer, ran around on her. She can\\'t get that out of her head. That\\'s how she caught onto him. The phone bills. MAVIS\\' VOICE She hasn\\'t developed much skill at holding a man. STU You know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is? She was so sure I was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me back to you. I thought I\\'d feel all guilty about it -- but I guess it hasn\\'t kicked in yet. (beat) Still, I wouldn\\'t do anything to hurt her. Basically, Kelly\\'s a decent individual. MAVIS\\' VOICE What about hurting me? Like last time? STU Hurt? You were glad to be rid of me. MAVIS\\' VOICE For a while I was, \\'til I took stock of what was around. You\\'re the lesser of many evils. STU That\\'s about the nicest thing you ever said. MAVIS\\' VOICE I\\'ll have it engraved. STU We\\'ve been up front with each other from the beginning. Let\\'s keep it that way. How about a drink? Say seven o\\'clock? The Monkey Bar? MAVIS\\' VOICE Meet me in front. I don\\'t like walking in there unescorted. STU Yeah, you\\'re great enough looking to be mistaken for one of those thousand dollar a night girls. MAVIS\\' VOICE It happens all the time lately. STU And wear that short black number I bought you from Bendel\\'s. MAVIS\\' VOICE Again? I don\\'t know if it\\'s me or that dress you like. STU Have a good day. Make plenty of tips. And leave the whole evening open. She thinks I\\'ve got Knicks tickets. He hangs up. Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his jacket pocket, flips it open and dials. Someone answers on the first ring. COLUMNIST (V.O.) Speak! STU (into cellular) It\\'s your boy Stuart. When was the last time I called you for a favor? COLUMNIST (V.O.) The column is already full. STU I just need one line. Anybody you wanna say was seen dining out at Mario\\'s Stromboli restaurant. COLUMNIST (V.O.) Maybe you don\\'t hear so good? I got no space for you. STU Who\\'s asking any favors? I\\'m offering reciprocal information. COLUMNIST (V.O.) Since when were you ever a reliable source? STU Check it out. Tony award-winning producer Willie Beagle tossed his wife back into rehab again following her third attempt at diving off the terrace at their plush eighteen room residence at the San Remo. I got it from the doorman. COLUMNIST (V.O.) I got it from their maid yesterday. It\\'s in the paper today. Or don\\'t you bother to read my shit? STU Louis, my intentions were entirely honorable. COLUMNIST (V.O.) I\\'ll drop your item in sometime next week. If you promise not to call me for a month. He hangs up. Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone and tucks it away. Then he starts to vacate the booth. The phone rings. And rings. Curious, he picks up the receiver. There\\'s a voice on the other end of the line. A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE. VOICE Don\\'t even think about leaving that booth. STU What? VOICE Stay exactly where you are and listen carefully. STU I\\'ve got a heavy day, mister. VOICE You know better than to disobey me. STU I don\\'t know you at all. VOICE Are you absolutely sure? STU Who is this? VOICE Someone who\\'s watching you. STU Get lost! VOICE Love the gray suit. That red and black tie makes a nice combination. Stu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel. He looks around nervously. STU Where? Where are you? VOICE Closer than you think. STU I don\\'t see you. VOICE There are any number of windows. Check them out. Indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise buildings and hotels. STU Okay, you had your little joke. VOICE I\\'m not sufficiently amused. Not yet. We have more to talk about. Stu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him not to. Perhaps it\\'s the strange tone of the man\\'s voice. STU Do me a favor. Call up somebody else. VOICE But it\\'s you I\\'m interested in. You know how many people use that booth every day? STU Why don\\'t you tell me? VOICE Better than two-hundred people on average. STU Is that what you do? Count them? VOICE What else do I have to do? It\\'s interesting watching people. Trying to guess who they are. And what they\\'re up to. STU What are you -- a shut-in of some kind? VOICE You might say that. I can\\'t go out. I might be seen. STU Somebody\\'s looking for you? VOICE Desperately. STU The cops? VOICE Not yet. STU The ex-wife. What\\'d you do -- run out on child support? VOICE What kind of man do you think I am? STU Frankly, I could care less. You had your fun. Now goodbye. VOICE It\\'s not in your best interests to hang up on me. That would make me angry. STU Isn\\'t that just too bad? VOICE For you. STU There\\'s ten million names in the phonebook. Pester somebody else. VOICE I never talk to people I can\\'t see. I need to study their reactions. STU Alright, bullshit artist, what am I doing right now? VOICE Scratching your forehead with your left hand. Now you\\'re brushing your hair back. STU Okay, okay, you got me in your scrutiny. So what? VOICE So let\\'s talk. STU Only I got nothing to say. VOICE Oh, you will. You\\'ll do a lot of talking before this conversation is over. And it\\'ll only end when I want it to. STU Is that a fact? Well if you watch closely, you will see me hang up. VOICE I don\\'t think you will. STU Why not? VOICE I interest you. STU Why should I be interested in some creep who gets his jollies spying on strangers in phone booths? VOICE But you\\'re not a stranger, Stu. The sound of his own name sends a chill through him. STU Who put you up to this? VOICE You were my very own selection. STU Why me in particular? VOICE Because you\\'re so afraid. STU Ha! What\\'ve I got to be afraid of? STU Just about everything. You have so much to hide. STU How do you figure that? VOICE Why else would a man with a perfectly good cellular bother to make calls from a pay booth? STU That\\'s my business. VOICE I\\'ve made it mine. STU All of a sudden I\\'m required to give explanations to you? VOICE In explicit detail. STU What is this? Some kind of candid camera gag? Or like that thing on HBO where the cab driver is taping what goes on in the back seat? VOICE This is not showbusiness, my friend. This is reality. STU Your reality. Not mine, you lowlife fuck. VOICE Stu, you\\'ll be made to suffer for your attitude, so let\\'s dispense with the vulgarities. STU Now you\\'re threatening me! Fuck you. Could that be any clearer? VOICE You\\'re only making it easier for me to do you harm. STU Oh yeah. Right. Can you see how I\\'m trembling? VOICE You will be. STU Shit, this is a new one. Fucking threatening calls in a goddam phone booth. When are you going to start with the heavy breathing. VOICE I\\'m not the degenerate. You are, Stu. STU You don\\'t know anything about me. VOICE Infinitely more than you know about me. STU Like what? VOICE Like the number you dialed when you first entered the booth. STU How would you know that? VOICE I\\'m watching through a scope and I could clearly read the buttons you pushed. I have another extension here by the window. Shall I dial that same number back for you? Would that convince you? Stu nervously cranes his neck, looking around at all the tall buildings that surround the street corner. STU\\'S POV PANNING up at thousands of windows. The Voice could be coming from anywhere. BACK TO STU IN THE BOOTH VOICE Let\\'s see who\\'s on the other end of the line. STU Don\\'t. VOICE Too late. (beat) It\\'s already ringing. I\\'ll hold the receiver up so you can listen in. Stu can hear the beeping as the other line rings. Then Mavis\\' voice can be heard answering. Stu listens helplessly. MAVIS\\' VOICE Hello? VOICE Well, hello. MAVIS\\' VOICE Who is this? VOICE Someone who\\'s really tight with your boyfriend -- who just called you from his favorite phone booth. MAVIS\\' VOICE You know Stu? VOICE Stu? Oh, I know him better than anyone. What he does -- how he thinks. How he lies. MAVIS\\' VOICE Who the hell is this? VOICE Stu is listening in. He knows what we\\'re both saying. MAVIS\\' VOICE Stu? Is that true? Are you there? VOICE He doesn\\'t feel like talking. STU (shouts) Mavis! Just hang up the goddam phone. VOICE She can\\'t hear you, Stu. Only me. (a pause) Mavis, I\\'m afraid Stu hasn\\'t been totally honest with you. But then he can\\'t be honest with anyone, can he? MAVIS\\' VOICE What\\'s your name? To whom am I speaking? VOICE You\\'ve never heard of me, Mavis. He doesn\\'t want you to know I exist. He wishes I didn\\'t exist. But there isn\\'t anything he can do about that. (beat) Still there, Stu? All you can do is listen. STU Mavis -- the guy is a fucking nutcase! Hang the fuck up. VOICE She doesn\\'t want to. She wants to know all about us. Don\\'t you, Mavis? MAVIS\\' VOICE Did his wife put you up to this? That bitch, Kelly? VOICE Oh yes, the bitch wife, Kelly. My very next call. STU (yells) He doesn\\'t know my wife! Don\\'t tell him anything else. Outside the booth, a huge, heavy-set black woman in a too tight dress, now appears with the clear desire to use the phone. Her name is FELICIA. She taps on the glass. FELICIA Could you hurry it along? Stu ignores her and Felicia glares at him through the glass with hostility. Stu has no inclination to deal with anybody else. He\\'s too distracted by the madness happening over the telephone. STU Can you hear me, Mavis? Keep your big mouth shut. VOICE Is that any way to talk to a woman you love? (beat) Mavis, is he always that abusive to you? MAVIS\\' VOICE You\\'re getting me all upset. I don\\'t know who you are or how you know all this -- VOICE I find out things -- from watching people and listening to them. MAVIS\\' VOICE Just what is your relationship to Stu? That\\'s all I want to know. VOICE Well, what do you think? MAVIS\\' VOICE Answer me, goddam it! VOICE Well alright. Stu and I are -- longtime companions. A pair. Two of a kind. Closer than close. Peas in a pod. Spoons in a drawer. MAVIS\\' VOICE You pervert! VOICE That, too. STU Don\\'t believe a word of it. It\\'s all lies. VOICE Too late, Stu. She already believes it. MAVIS\\' VOICE You can tell that scumbag never to bother me again. VOICE He won\\'t care. He\\'ll still have me. STU It\\'s not true. I do care. From outside the booth, there\\'s a louder rapping on the glass. Felicia really wants in. FELICIA Get done in there, mister. I got me an important call. STU Go away. FELICIA Shit I will! Finish up! She continues to rap on the glass as Stu tries to focus on the two-way phone call. VOICE Why don\\'t you tell me what you think of us? MAVIS\\' VOICE You\\'re both disgusting. VOICE That\\'s what he said about you. Well, if Stu didn\\'t have the balls to come out and tell you the truth, I felt it was my responsibility to clear the air. Goodbye now, Mavis. Thanks for your time. (the phone clicks off; we hear only a dial tone) Back to you again, Stu. STU You total asshole! How could you do that? VOICE Speaking of females, that woman hovering outside the booth -- may as well tell her that you\\'ll be on the line forever. STU Like hell I will. VOICE I\\'m ready for you to take out your cellular and phone home. And this time, I\\'ll listen in. STU There\\'s no chance of that. VOICE Or should I call Kelly and make up something totally outrageous? You must realize by now I have a vivid imagination. STU You don\\'t know our phone number! VOICE Are you absolutely sure? I may have been watching you on a regular basis. Keeping track of all the numbers I see you dial. STU And I\\'m supposed to believe that? VOICE I\\'ve put a great deal of preparation into this -- prior to actually saying hello. Now do you want to dial 832-7165 -- or should I? The sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even more than the earlier mention of his name. STU What are you going to tell her? VOICE You\\'ll do the talking. STU What am I supposed to say? VOICE Try telling her the truth. STU Look, I don\\'t want to hurt Kelly. She\\'s always there for me. It\\'s just my nature to have a little \\'strange\\' on the side. It doesn\\'t mean shit. VOICE But you still find it necessary? STU Kind of like having a beautiful home. With everything you ever dreamed of. But you still need that vacation now and then. Some nice hotel room with a great view. Maybe a pool. Only you wouldn\\'t want to spend more than a few days in any hotel. Eventually, you want to go back to your home and all your stuff. You\\'re real glad to check out. VOICE Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel? I\\'m sure they\\'ll both appreciate that explanation. STU You\\'re ruining my fucking life, you sonofabitch. VOICE Didn\\'t I warn you about calling me names? It makes me vindictive. STU What else can you do to me? VOICE We haven\\'t even begun. STU She\\'s not home. She went out. VOICE I\\'ll bet she\\'s back. Now hold the cellular up where I can see it -- so I can be certain you don\\'t misdial on me. (pause) A little higher and to your left. Now I have it in perfect view. Dial slowly. More violent rapping on the glass from the persistent black lady outside. FELICIA If you got you a cell phone, how come you taking up the whole fucking booth! This here\\'s an emergency! STU There\\'s another booth on the next block. FELICIA It\\'s busted. Every damn phone on Eighth Avenue is busted but this one. STU Well, I\\'m not through! Go in a restaurant or someplace, but get away from me! FELICIA I\\'m gonna pull you out of that booth and snatch you ballheaded! She tries to pull open the sliding door to the booth but Stu jams it shut, right on her hand. FELICIA You assaulted my person. STU Let me hear from your lawyer! FELICIA You\\'re hear alright. I\\'m coming back. And your ass better not be around. She stalks off obviously in search of assistance. VOICE Good work, Stu. Now let me see you dial. Tuck the receiver under your chin and dial your remote. STU I\\'m doing it. He punches in the digits. The phone rings -- and rings. STU I told you she was out. VOICE Let it ring. Then a girl\\'s voice is heard. KELLY\\'S VOICE Shepard residence. VOICE Hold it close to the receiver so I can hear. KELLY\\'S VOICE Hello? STU Honey, it\\'s me. KELLY\\'S VOICE What\\'s taking you so long? I thought we were having some lunch at Mario\\'s? STU Change of plan. We\\'re not eating in that dump any more. KELLY\\'S VOICE How come? STU The Health Department gave them a \\'C\\' rating -- that\\'s how come. Here I\\'m trying to put the place on the map and he fucks it all up with a major roach problem. KELLY\\'S VOICE That\\'s disgusting. Okay, I\\'ll fix us a sandwich. Where are you now? STU Just in a phone booth. KELLY\\'S VOICE How come? The caller ID says you\\'re on your cellular. STU Oh yeah, I am. KELLY\\'S VOICE But you\\'re also in some phone booth? VOICE Explain that one, Stu. STU I only stepped in because the traffic was so loud outside. KELLY\\'S VOICE Well just hurry on back. VOICE Tell her you can\\'t. STU Not for a few minutes. KELLY\\'S VOICE Are you sure you\\'re alone? I hear somebody in the background. STU The guy in the next booth. He\\'s got a bad connection and he\\'s hollering his fool head off. VOICE You\\'ve got an answer for everything. STU I love you, baby. KELLY\\'S VOICE Do you? STU You know that. KELLY\\'S VOICE Stu -- who was that man? STU What man? KELLY\\'S VOICE Some person who phoned fifteen minutes ago -- just after you went out. STU I don\\'t understand... KELLY\\'S VOICE This total stranger rang up and told me to wait by the phone -- because you\\'d be calling me in a few minutes -- from a booth. And I said what would he be doing in any phone booth? STU And what did this guy say? KELLY\\'S VOICE He said you\\'d be making phone calls. What else? STU Making calls is part of my business. KELLY\\'S VOICE To whom? STU Clients. People. Planting items like I do. KELLY\\'S VOICE Women? STU Once in a while one of them could be a woman. I just called \"Elaine\\'s\" and talked to her to see who was in there last night. KELLY\\'S VOICE You know exactly what I mean. STU You\\'re not going to start that shit again? KELLY\\'S VOICE I just feel something is wrong. STU What could be wrong? KELLY\\'S VOICE The way you sound. You don\\'t sound like yourself. STU Yeah? Who do I sound like? KELLY\\'S VOICE Someone who\\'s scared. There\\'s fear in your voice like I\\'ve never heard before. VOICE See, Stu? Kelly agrees with me. KELLY\\'S VOICE I want you to come back home. Now! STU I told you. In a while. KELLY\\'S VOICE No. I want you here now. In case he calls back, I don\\'t want to answer again. STU Why should he call back? KELLY\\'S VOICE I feel like he\\'s going to. STU You\\'re the one that sounds frightened. And of nobody. KELLY\\'S VOICE He\\'s not a nobody. He knows about us. STU You\\'re not telling me all he said. What are you holding back? KELLY\\'S VOICE I can\\'t discuss it on the phone. Just get over here! CLICK! She hangs up. STU (into pay phone) Why did you do that to her? She never did you any harm. VOICE How would you know? Everybody does harm to somebody. And then they try their best to forget it. STU Maybe me -- but not her. Whatever I\\'ve done, there\\'s no reason to take it out on her. VOICE Suppose that\\'s the only way I can get to you? You claim you love her. STU Yeah, I do. VOICE You don\\'t even love yourself. STU But Kelly... I would never hurt. VOICE Still you have to uphold your status as an honorary asshole. STU Listen, I\\'ve treated all my women decent. I never laid a hand on any of them, even when provoked. And I always let them down easy. (beat) I\\'m not ready to let Kelly go. Maybe I never will be. VOICE What if she dumps you first? What\\'s the odds she\\'s already taken up with somebody? One day soon you\\'ll come home and find her gone along with the CD player and the VCR. STU I\\'m not gonna let you mind-fuck me all day! That\\'s it. This call is ended. VOICE Not until I say it is. STU What happens if I hang up? VOICE You don\\'t really want to find out. STU I\\'m dying to hear this!!! What the fuck can you do about it -- up in your fucking high window with your goddam binoculars? VOICE I never indicated I had binoculars. I said I had a highly magnified telescopic image of you that brought you up so close I could see where you nicked yourself under the chin shaving this morning. STU Oh -- while you\\'re at it, have a look up my ass. VOICE I may very well do that, Stu. In the meantime, think about what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it. STU What? You mean... like a rifle? VOICE A high-powered .30 calibre bolt action Remington 700 with a carbon one modification and a state of the art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope. And you\\'re in the cross hairs, Stu. STU I\\'m supposed to believe that? VOICE There\\'s only one way I can prove it to you. Hang up the receiver and find out. At this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine. STU And you\\'re just going to kill me for no reason? VOICE For plenty of reasons! Because you hung up. For years I hated people hanging up on me. Ex-girlfriends. Women I didn\\'t even know. Prospective employers. STU I get hung up on all the time. You get used to it. VOICE Or else you don\\'t. I worked for months getting people to switch to MCI -- being insulted at and being hung up on hundreds of times a day. The ones that cursed me out for invading their privacy never bothered me as much as those that clicked off without even bothering to reply. STU Then why didn\\'t you go after one of them? VOICE Maybe you are one of them. STU Hey, I have worked in a boiler room myself peddling \"Term Life.\" I Would never be rude to a fellow salesperson. VOICE Can you feel it on you now? The heat of it. I\\'m moving the strike zone down to your stomach area. Now I\\'m raising it up again. Directly above the chest cavity -- sliding up to the forehead just above the left ear. STU Shit -- I do feel it. VOICE Tell me where I\\'m going with it now. STU Across my forehead -- now back where it was before. VOICE I\\'m amazed how you can do that. You\\'re amazingly accurate. (beat) Now I know what you\\'re thinking. If I drop down on the floor of the booth and flatten myself out... STU No, I\\'m not thinking that. VOICE Oh yes you are. Can I crawl out using the booth as a shield? Can I crawl to that Chrysler illegally parked only three or four feet away? The shattering glass may cut me, but it\\'ll only be superficial. Otherwise, this lunatic will never let me out alive. STU No. You will. I know you will. If I just cooperate. VOICE Where is it now? Think and feel for the warm spot. STU Below the shoulder? VOICE Which one? STU The right shoulder. VOICE Remarkable how we\\'re in tune. You\\'re doing far better than the others. STU What others? What do you mean? (no reply) You said \\'others!\\' VOICE (finally) I\\'m sure you read about the Italian tourist shot dead ten days ago at the corner of Forty-fifth and Eighth? STU I saw it on the news. VOICE And where are we now? STU Oh, God. Forty-fifth and Eighth. VOICE What else do you remember about that killing? STU I don\\'t know. VOICE Try. STU He was gunned down. And nobody was caught. And they didn\\'t even bother to take his wallet or his watch... or anything. VOICE Now you know why. It wasn\\'t a robbery. STU What did he do? VOICE He hung up -- so I disconnected him permanently. STU Please -- don\\'t do it to me. You got no reason to do it to me. VOICE Don\\'t give me reason. STU I\\'m not looking to. Tell me what you want! VOICE Tell me about your job. STU What\\'s to tell? I\\'m in Public Relations. They used to call us \"flacks.\" Now we\\'re media consultants. VOICE What do you do, exactly? STU Plant items in the paper and on the tube. More important sometimes, keep stuff out. VOICE What\\'ve you kept out? STU One of my people got nailed for indecent exposure. I managed for the cops to use his real name instead of his stage name so nobody picked up on it. VOICE You saved the little deviate\\'s ass, didn\\'t you? STU He\\'s in major therapy now. I swear he is. VOICE You must hang with some major celebrities. Journalists, newscasters -- those types. STU I\\'m real close with Larry King. And the \"Hard Copy\" people. VOICE Could you get him down here? Larry King? STU Why would he want to come here? VOICE Because you asked him to. STU He comes from Atlanta. VOICE Well, who could you get? STU I don\\'t know. VOICE Wolf Blitzer? VOICE Probably not. VOICE Regis? STU Definitely no chance. VOICE You\\'d be offering them an exclusive newsbreak. I\\'m talking about more than one homicide. STU How many? VOICE I don\\'t answer questions. I ask them. STU I gotta have the facts. They might not believe me. My record isn\\'t too good when it comes to hard news. VOICE You\\'re not considered a reliable source? STU On a divorce or separation, maybe. Or who\\'s gay, or who isn\\'t gay any more. I kind of specialize in that kind of material. I mean I could probably get you Joe Franklin. VOICE How about Cindy Adams? STU I might have a shot. Are you familiar with Liz Smith? VOICE Do you know her number? STU Want I should call her? How much can I say? VOICE Tell her you\\'re in direct touch with a killer who\\'s willing to speak honestly if she shows up here alone and without notifying the authorities. STU She usually likes to have a celebrity involved. If you had an actor or a sports figure held prisoner instead of me, there\\'d be better odds she\\'s come. VOICE Then lie. Pick a celebrity and put them in the booth. STU Let\\'s see. Who does she like? Who couldn\\'t be reached to deny it? VOICE I\\'m anxious to see you in action. Don\\'t keep me waiting. Stu uses his cellular again. STU (dialing) Sometimes you only get her service. (into cellular) Hi -- Stu Shepard. Put me through. I\\'ve got hard news for her. I can only talk to her directly. But say it regards -- Liza. VOICE Liza? That was imaginative. STU (into cellular) No, I can\\'t call back. I\\'ll have to lay in on somebody else. Alright, but I can\\'t hang on long. (to pay phone) She\\'s coming on. (to cellular) Liz, hello. Sure I\\'ll make it brief. Killing two weeks ago in the theatre district? Turn out a sniper did the job. Yeah, a sniper with a rifle. Now he\\'s got another victim lined up. Not just your anonymous New Yorker, but Liza. Now you can\\'t call anybody or Ms. Minelli\\'s dead meat and so am I. She\\'s hostage in a phone booth right in the sniper\\'s sights. But he says he\\'ll talk to you and let her walk. I know it\\'ll take balls to do this, but you\\'re a fine and courageous newspaper woman... There\\'s a click. Silence. STU Hello? Hello? (to pay phone) Either she\\'s on her way over or she doesn\\'t believe me. VOICE You weren\\'t particularly convincing. STU I didn\\'t really believe in what I was saying. VOICE Because you don\\'t really believe my Remington is pointed at you? STU I do. VOICE You\\'re ninety percent sure. STU At least ninety-five percent, easy. VOICE Let me erase all doubt. STU No. Don\\'t shoot. VOICE Control yourself, Stu. Glance down at your chest. What do you see. STU Oh, my God. A dot. A fucking red dot. A tiny red dot now moves across Stu\\'s chest. VOICE Like you\\'ve seen in the movies? STU The laser dot. Just before some poor bastard always gets blown away. VOICE Usually a supporting player. That lovely but by now generic special effect of the bullet piercing the forehead. The tiny red laser dot dances around Stu\\'s chest and stomach -- the jumps up and remains between his eyes. VOICE This takes all the guesswork out of it. You know exactly where to expect it before I even tighten my finger on the trigger. STU Don\\'t tighten. Don\\'t even tickle that fucking finger. VOICE How about Geraldo? He\\'s run his ass off to get in on this. STU You\\'re talking about the old Geraldo. Look, I can try and reach cable NBC. They\\'re hungry. VOICE I\\'m disappointed. I wanted to go first class. STU They do a great job. They\\'ll haul a whole crew over to cover your surrender \"live.\" VOICE I never expressed interest in giving myself up. There are so many other phone booths in the city. I\\'m just getting warmed up. STU That\\'s entirely up to you. Your choice. I\\'m just trying to set you up with the proper communicator. (beat) I suppose Liza wasn\\'t strong enough. I should\\'ve said Madonna. VOICE Now you\\'re being creative. Outside the booth, the angry black woman has returned, bringing with her a gaudily dressed pimp named LEON who looks like he means business. He slams his fist against the glass, nearly shattering it. LEON Drag your baggy butt out of that booth. We got business to conduct out of there. FELICIA He been in there all day. STU I\\'m not through. LEON Hang up that receiver or I\\'ll make you eat the fucking thing! STU Fuck off or I\\'ll call a cop. LEON Do you see one around here? What you think I\\'m gonna be doing while you\\'re waiting for a prowl car to get assigned? I\\'m about to cut you a second asshole if you don\\'t vacate those premises. STU I can\\'t. FELICIA He\\'s got him a fucking cellular. What\\'s he need to be on our booth for? STU I can\\'t explain it. LEON I\\'m not interested in your explanations even if you had any. He withdraws a switchblade knife from his pocket but doesn\\'t open it -- yet. LEON If I flick this, I use it. STU I\\'ll make it worth your while to go away. How much do you want? LEON Make me an offer. STU Thirty dollars. It\\'s all I\\'ve got in cash. Take it and go. LEON You\\'re offering to rent my phone booth? For how long? STU I don\\'t know. For as long as it takes. LEON What\\'s so special in there? STU Do you want the money? LEON Is that a genuine Rolex you\\'ve got on? STU Come on, man. That\\'s my good watch. LEON That\\'s what it\\'s gonna take. STU Then here. Take the damn thing. LEON And the thirty! STU Take it all. The pimp pockets the watch and the money. But doesn\\'t go away. LEON Now I\\'m satisfied. But you still got to deal with Felicia here. I believe you spoke harshly to her. STU I apologize. LEON And did her some injury. STU An accident. I\\'m sorry about that, too. FELICIA The man don\\'t sound like he means it. LEON I agree. (to Stu) Why don\\'t you hang up a minute so we can discuss this matter at length. STU It\\'s long distance. I can\\'t lose the call -- I might not get them back. LEON Do I have to rip that fucking phone out of there? STU That wouldn\\'t be a good idea. (into pay phone) Would it? VOICE Not at all. STU I gave you everything I\\'ve got. LEON That pinky ring looks attractive. Felicia might like that. FELICIA It might fit. STU You want the ring, you\\'ve got the ring. If I can get it off. LEON I can get it off you. Leon reaches in and grabs Stu\\'s ring hand. STU Let go of me! It\\'s coming loose. There. (he tosses it) Okay, Felicia, with my deepest apologies. Goodbye now. LEON What\\'s really going on in that booth -- that escapes the naked eye? STU Nothing. Talk. That\\'s all. LEON That your connection on the end of the line? Or are you dealing? STU This has nothing to do with drugs. LEON You gotta be high on something to willingly divest yourself of your valuables -- just to maintain occupancy of a fucking phone booth that the local bums piss in every night. STU I knew it smelled for some reason. LEON You look like you\\'re ready to piss yourself. STU Because I am. LEON Maybe if the city provided decent public toilets, folks wouldn\\'t relieve themselves in the subway stations and phone booths! STU I\\'ll take it up with the mayor. LEON Next thing you know you\\'re gonna claim we mugged you -- took your billfold and watch. STU No, you didn\\'t. It was a fair and equitable deal. You had territorial rights to this booth and I paid a license fee. Fair is fair. Now leave me in peace. LEON You sure you\\'re alright? (to Felicia) He don\\'t look well. FELICIA Kind of pale. Even for a white man. LEON Jaundice they calls it. Probably advanced liver trouble. (to Stu) If it\\'s cirrhosis, you better find yourself a twelve step program and quick. STU Thanks for your interest but I\\'m in perfect health. FELICIA So how come his hand is shaking? LEON The man is cracking up. FELICIA Lookit the sweat pouring off the sonofabitch. That\\'s one sick mother you started up with, Leon! LEON Me? You\\'re the one that brought me over and exposed me to all his germs. STU I\\'m terminal, okay? Now can I close the booth and continue my conversation? LEON I\\'m worried now it might be catching. All that money out of your sweaty pocket is probably crawling with some rare and incurable disease. STU Fine. Give it back. LEON What good\\'s that? We done touched it. STU Well go wash your hands. LEON Come on now. Own up to what you\\'re carrying. Is it some of that sexually transmitted shit? Cause in that case, we can relax. STU I\\'m sick of you. Now get out of my face. LEON Here we\\'s being solicitous as to your health and you respond by heaping abuse! FELICIA Whip his arrogant ass. Leon reaches into the booth and grabs Stu\\'s jacket. STU Touch me and I\\'ll throw up on you. At the suggestion, Leon lets go quickly. It looks like a stalemate. Stu isn\\'t vacating the booth and Leon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further. He does indeed look sick. STU (into pay phone) You can see what I\\'m up against here. VOICE Want me to get rid of him for you? STU What do you have in mind? VOICE I\\'ll think of something. Suddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp. Leon doesn\\'t realize it\\'s there. The hooker behind him has no way of seeing it. But to Stu, there\\'s no way to miss it. He reacts. STU God -- no. (into pay phone) Don\\'t. It\\'s not necessary. VOICE You asked for my help. STU I\\'ll handle it myself. VOICE You\\'re not doing too well. I can settle it in a fraction of a second. Shall I demonstrate? STU No. (to Leon) For your own safety, mister, just walk away. LEON Now the man is turning aggressive... issuing threats upon my person. STU You\\'re making this happen. LEON If you don\\'t hang up and step out, I\\'m about to topple this booth into the gutter with you inside it. Reluctant to touch Stu again, Leon assaults the booth itself. He begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its foundation. And the rickety booth is not too sturdy. It starts rocking back and forth. Stu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing. STU (into pay phone) This isn\\'t my fault. (shouts) Stop that! But Leon continues rocking the booth. It won\\'t come loose -- so in frustration, he punches in a side pane of glass. The glass shatters all around Stu, who does his best to shield himself from the slivers. STU (into pay phone) The guy\\'s insane! VOICE Only one way to stop a mad dog. Give me permission. STU I can\\'t. VOICE If he forces you out of that booth, I\\'ve told you what to expect. You or him, Stu. Leon is smashing other panes of glass now -- one after another -- as Stu cowers inside. FELICIA Don\\'t cut yourself, honey. A crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to watch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth and its occupant. DERELICT Looks like the fucker is comin\\' loose. STREET PERSON Shove it out into the oncoming traffic. DERELICT What\\'ll you bet the bus could knock that fifty feet? The booth is being decimated but Stu hangs onto the phone. STU (into pay phone) Hello? Hello? VOICE (with heavy static) You\\'re breaking up. We\\'re about to be cut off. STU I can\\'t help it! VOICE That counts as a hang-up. STU No. It can\\'t. That\\'s not fair. VOICE I can still make him stop. Say the word. Can you hear me? STU Yes. Stu sees the red dot reappear on Leon\\'s chest as he continues to barrage the booth with punches and kicks. Then Leon recoils, staggers a step backward. He doesn\\'t realize he\\'s been shot. There\\'s been no sound of gunfire. Perhaps a silencer was used -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary discharge. Leon looks confused at first. His ladyfriend has no idea he\\'s wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people who\\'ve assembled on the corner. Even Stu isn\\'t sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the wound on the pimp\\'s chest -- staining his yellow vest. He isn\\'t assaulting the booth anymore. He\\'s trying to keep his balance. He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for support -- only a few inches from Stu\\'s face. The blood runs down the side of the booth. STU (into pay phone) You did it! VOICE You said \\'yes.\\' STU I said \\'Yes, I can hear you.\\' Not \\'Yes -- kill the motherfucker!\\' VOICE Don\\'t try to renege on it. I was following orders. STU You\\'re twisting it all around. I didn\\'t do this! Meanwhile, Leon leans upright against the booth. Then his legs cave in and he begins to slide to his knees. Felicia runs up beside him. She sees the blood. FELICIA I warned you not to cut yourself. (to crowd) Look at all that blood. He must\\'ve hit an artery. She screams as Leon topples backwards onto the pavement. Now his chest wound is evident. FELICIA Oh, Jesus. What is that? Talk to me! What happened? The crowd tightens around the fallen body. Street people who are fascinated but not shocked. DERELICT Gunshot! STREET PERSON Yeah. Sucking chest wound right over the heart. FELICIA Somebody call an ambulance. STREET PERSON Call the meatwagon. He\\'s fucked up. FELICIA You shut the fuck up! Her focus turns to Stu in the battered phone booth. FELICIA Why did you do that to him? STU I didn\\'t. FELICIA (to crowd) You all saw it! He shot my man without no provocation! DERELICT Yeah. Pumped one right into him at close range. STU How could I? I don\\'t even have a gun. Look! STREET PERSON Everybody get the fuck back! They shoot one -- then they shoot everybody in sight! Kill all the fucking witnesses! The crowd disperses to doorways and around the corner -- out of immediate range. STU Come back. You\\'ve got to see -- I\\'m not armed. Only Felicia remains, leaning over the pimp\\'s body, staring helplessly. FELICIA Hang up and dial 911. Get a doctor! STU I can\\'t hang up. That\\'s what this is all about. FELICIA You\\'re gonna stand there and let him die? STU (takes out cellular) I can use this. (he dials) Emergency. Yes. There\\'s been a shooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth -- on the corner. A man is down. What\\'s the difference who I am? I don\\'t want to be involved. FELICIA (shouts) That\\'s bullshit. He\\'s the shooter. You\\'re talking to the shooter. Stu quickly disconnects the cellular. STU That wasn\\'t nice. FELICIA Go ahead -- make a fucking run for it. I hope they gun you down -- like you did him! STU I\\'m not going anyplace. I\\'m staying right here in this booth. (into pay phone) Unless you give me permission. VOICE You\\'re attracting a lot of attention. I suppose when the police get there, you\\'ll accuse me. STU What do you expect me to say? VOICE That\\'s up to you. But any mention of me will not be appreciated. STU You mean...? VOICE You won\\'t even get to finish your sentence. Oh look, that little red dot is dancing around all over you again. You saw how quickly it can happen. And how accurate I can be. STU They can\\'t blame me -- I\\'m not armed. VOICE Who\\'s going to believe that? With all those witnesses to the contrary. STU They can see with their own eyes. Not far away, we hear the BLAST of POLICE SIRENS drawing closer. VOICE Remember to leave me out of it. STU How can I? VOICE You\\'ll put the proper spin on it. Isn\\'t that your specialty? Feeding the public a story that may not have a shred of truth -- and making it totally believable? STU This isn\\'t a story. This is real. This is murder. VOICE If you\\'d only dealt with the man reasonably, shown him some respect, this might not have been necessary. STU I gave him my money, my watch... VOICE But not your respect. Which is what he required of you. STU He was a fucking thief. VOICE And now he\\'s a fucking dead thief. Do you feel better about that? STU I don\\'t feel a bit guilty. This is all your doing! VOICE Now you\\'re being disrespectful of me. You never learn. Your job is to deal with people -- but you\\'re not good at it. STU Hey, I\\'m not taking any more criticism from some lunatic sniper who gets his kicks killing strangers. VOICE You keep insisting I\\'m a stranger. Probably because you don\\'t recognize the voice. But there are cheap electronic devices available that disguise the voice. I might not even be a man. I might be one of those many women you\\'ve almost totally forgotten. One who doesn\\'t forgive easily. One who wants to watch you squirm. STU You\\'re a man. I know you\\'re a man. Women don\\'t kill with telescopic rifles. They stab you. VOICE You sound so sure of that. But you\\'ve never provoked any man as much as have the women in your life. And so many of them, Stu. (a beat) Do you even remember their names? STU I\\'ve got no time to rehash my whole life. Oh my God! The cops are here. Police cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue. Traffic has suddenly been shut down. Prowl cars have now blocked the streets. PRODUCTION NOTE: Everything is seen from Stu\\'s perspective without intercuts. Half a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns. FELICIA (pointing) That\\'s him -- in the booth. He\\'s got a gun! As she hurls accusations, she\\'s lugging Leon\\'s lifeless body out into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue. It\\'s a bright afternoon. In the distance, we hear the maddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being rerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of irate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their simplest form of protest. It\\'s a discordant concert that echoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels... As the cops surround the booth -- at a distance. SERGEANT (into bullhorn) Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised. STU (into phone) They\\'re ordering me to come out. VOICE I can see that. Ignore them. STU What if they open fire? VOICE They probably won\\'t. Look across on the east side of the street. Do you see the tourist with the home video camera? STU\\'S POV A distant crowd gathering on the opposite west side corner behind the police cars. Some tourist is capturing the event on video. BACK TO STU STU What about him? VOICE He\\'s going to keep the police on their best behavior. So long as you don\\'t take what could be interpreted as hostile action, you\\'ll be safe. STU You call this safe? Six cops with guns pointed my way? VOICE You want me to reduce them to three -- or two? STU Absolutely no more shooting. Now is that clear? VOICE You can always change your mind. SERGEANT (with bullhorn) You know the drill. Hands clasped behind the back of your neck -- moving slowly -- step out of the booth. If we see any sign of a weapon, we will respond. STU (shouts) You won\\'t, because there isn\\'t any. SERGEANT (bullhorn) I repeat. Raise your hands. STU I can\\'t. I\\'m on a phone call. Now a black POLICE CAPTAIN arrives and takes full command of the situation. CAPTAIN RAMEY You have thirty seconds to comply. STU I told you. I\\'m busy. Come back later. VOICE Very good, Stu. The cops take cover behind parked cars, keeping Stu clearly in their sights. He has no place to hide. He\\'s in the battered phone booth in plain view from all sides. RAMEY You\\'ve been given an order. The Sergeant slides up beside the Captain to confer. PRODUCTION NOTE: We remain in LONG SHOT of the cops -- always from Stu\\'s POV. But we can hear their voices and all that is said as if they were in close up. It has an odd, unreal and distancing effect. SERGEANT We\\'re dealing with a mental case. He\\'s looking for us to kill him. RAMEY Well he\\'s not getting his wish. In the center of the street, an ambulance pulls up and a team of medics jump out. They rush to Leon\\'s body. (Again we hear their voices close, even though visually they are far off.) FELICIA Tell me he\\'s gonna be alright. MEDIC Step aside. Let us look at him. The medics push her aside -- then examine the victim. He\\'s DOA. MEDIC Nothing we can do. Don\\'t touch the body. They\\'ll need it to mark the crime scene. Far across the street, the Captain confers with his subordinates. They are small figures on the screen but we hear them sharply. SERGEANT Same corner as two weeks ago. RAMEY Maybe it\\'s more than a coincidence. Cover me. I need to talk to him. SERGEANT You\\'ve got your vest on? RAMEY What do you think? The Captain steps out of cover and boldly approaches the phone booth. He stops cautiously about fifteen feet away. RAMEY I\\'m not armed. STU Neither am I. RAMEY Yeah, sure. I need to know what happened. STU Can\\'t talk about it. RAMEY Sure you can. My name\\'s Ramey. Captain Ed Ramey. What\\'s yours? STU Look, I don\\'t want to be friends. RAMEY You look like you need a friend. VOICE Tell him you\\'ve already got a friend. STU (yells) I\\'ve got a friend, okay. RAMEY Is that who you\\'re talking to on the phone? STU None of your business. RAMEY When somebody gets shot, it becomes my business. Let\\'s not have anybody else killed. I want to hear your side of it. STU I\\'ve got no side of it. VOICE Don\\'t worry, Stu. I\\'ve got him fixed right in my sights. I won\\'t let him hurt you. RAMEY Has this happened to you before? The need to hurt someone? To put a bullet in them? STU You won\\'t believe anything I say. RAMEY Try me. STU I couldn\\'t shoot anybody. I\\'m not armed. RAMEY You\\'re right. I don\\'t believe you. What\\'s that bulge in your pants pocket? STU That? That\\'s my cellular. RAMEY A cellular? Then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls? STU Do you want to see it? RAMEY Don\\'t reach for it, mister. STU Then how can I show it to you? RAMEY I don\\'t need to see it. I know what\\'s there. All these witnesses saw you use it on him. From behind a parked car, a HOMELESS PERSON calls out. STREET PERSON (hollers) Damn straight! Another DERELICT, crouched in a doorway, joins in. DERELICT (shouts) Yeah! Shot him down like a dog! STU They\\'re all lying. Nobody saw it because it didn\\'t happen. RAMEY A man is dead but it didn\\'t happen. STU Not on account of me! This is like some bad dream. RAMEY You\\'re walking through a bad dream and you can\\'t wake up. Do you want to wake up? STU I\\'m trying. RAMEY And in this dream, you killed that man. He was bothering you so you iced him. STU No. RAMEY Then who did? VOICE Don\\'t tell him, Stu. Or it\\'ll be the last thing he ever hears. His blood will be on your hands. STU (to Ramey) I don\\'t know. RAMEY But you saw it happen? STU Yes. RAMEY You were the closest one to him. You must\\'ve seen who did it. STU No. RAMEY We\\'re trying to be honest with each other, aren\\'t we? STU Not necessarily. VOICE I\\'m losing patience with this cop. STU (into phone) I\\'m handling this. RAMEY Who do you keep talking to on the phone? STU Nobody. My psychiatrist. VOICE Excellent, Stu. You\\'re getting good at this. RAMEY What\\'s this doctor\\'s name? It\\'s important we know. STU He says not to tell you. It\\'s privileged information. VOICE Damn good reply. Now you\\'re having fun. Admit it. STU Whatever you say. VOICE Playing it so close to the edge. I\\'ll bet you\\'ve never felt so alive. That\\'s how I feel when I look through the sight and select somebody. The Captain begins advancing a few steps closer. RAMEY I respect your right to privacy. I\\'ve been to therapy myself. The department provides it. I know it\\'s not good form for a cop to be admitting that, but... VOICE Tell him not to come any closer. STU Stop right there. Back up a few steps. Back where you were. RAMEY If it makes you more comfortable. VOICE Tell him to read you your rights. STU I want you to read me my rights and stop asking questions. RAMEY Al least tell me your first name. STU It\\'s my right not to have any name. RAMEY No gun and no name. You\\'re a highly underprivileged person. VOICE Demand a lawyer. STU And get me a lawyer, too. I want a lawyer brought down here to negotiate my surrender. VOICE Brilliant, Stu. Keep winging it. RAMEY It\\'ll be hard to find a lawyer willing to risk his life. But if you hand over the gun... STU How can I when you won\\'t let me take it out? RAMEY We\\'ll take it out for you -- as soon as you exit the booth with your hands raised and... STU (interrupts) Now we\\'re back to that again. It\\'s always \"Get out of the booth.\\' \\'You can\\'t stay in the booth.\\' Well, I like it in the fucking booth. It\\'s my whole world now. It\\'s my booth and I\\'m never coming out. RAMEY We\\'re not about to force you because there could be a miscalculation and then we\\'d never find out why this happened. STU Why is it so important to know? The guy is dead. Isn\\'t that enough? Knowing isn\\'t going to make him alive again. So who gives a fuck! RAMEY It\\'s what makes the job interesting. Finding out why. Something drove you to do this. You didn\\'t go out today expecting this to happen. It was a nice day. You were out for a walk. And then suddenly it all changed. STU All I wanted was to make a phone call. One lousy phone call for thirty-five fucking cents. VOICE Careful, Stu. Don\\'t volunteer too much. RAMEY You got some bad news on that call. STU The worst. RAMEY Something that pushed you over the edge? STU And I\\'ve been falling ever since. RAMEY Time to land. STU When you hit bottom, you die. RAMEY I\\'m your safety net. STU If I tell you what you want to know -- you\\'ll die, too. Something about the implied threat sends a chill through Captain Ramey. INSERT SHOT The Captain\\'s head as seen through a telescopic sight. Ramey could be dead in an instant. PRODUCTION NOTE: The only time we deviate from Stu\\'s perspective is when we see the sniper\\'s POV through his scope. ANGLE BACK ON STU IN THE BOOTH, the detective fifteen feet away. Ramey decides to back off momentarily. RAMEY I\\'ll go see about that lawyer. STU Now that\\'s a good idea. The Captain withdraws back across the street. VOICE He\\'s lucky. I had him centered in my cross hairs. I really had to restrain myself. We hear the approach of a helicopter. Stu peers up ward as not one but two choppers appear above the tall buildings. VOICE It\\'s not the police. It\\'s the media. You\\'re news, Stuart. The helicopters circle above. VOICE You\\'ve never gotten this much press for any of your clients. I\\'m making you a famous person. STU They\\'re just hoping for coverage of me dying in the gutter. VOICE Their presence is putting the police on their continued best behavior. STU Those cops are just looking for any excuse. VOICE Then don\\'t give them one. Then, as if on cue, Stu\\'s cellular phone in his pocket starts ringing. But he can\\'t allows himself to reach for it. To do so might cause the police to believe he was trying to draw his gun. It rings quietly -- virtually inaudible outside the booth. Drowned out by the traffic horns, the static from the police radios and the newly introduced sound of television helicopters circling over Eighth Avenue taking video coverage of the event below. VOICE Who could it be? STU Kelly. She was worried about me. Stu is afraid to reach in his pocket lest the cops think he\\'s going for a gun. VOICE Maybe she\\'s seen this on television. It must be on every channel by now. Breaking news. STU She doesn\\'t watch daytime TV. VOICE One of the neighbors could\\'ve alerted her. The cell phone keeps ringing, almost drowned out by the sound of helicopters circling overhead. STU Why are you saying this? You want me to reach in my pocket so you can see them open fire? VOICE That\\'s an unwarranted accusation and very unbecoming in light of the good advice I\\'ve given in the past. Have I ever steered you wrong? STU God -- how I\\'d love to hear her voice. VOICE It might even be worth it. She\\'s insistent, isn\\'t she? The cellular won\\'t stop ringing. STU If she knows I\\'m in trouble, she won\\'t give up. VOICE Probably glued to the TV by now. I\\'m watching coverage on two stations now. Channel surfing. (pause) Well, there you are on two and four and five. Not any decent angles on you, though, stuck inside there. The cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is maddening. Stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide the cops with an excuse to open fire. VOICE But if you\\'d take one or two steps outside and look up, I think they could get a clear picture of you. STU You said I\\'m not allowed to leave the booth. Finally the cell phone stops ringing. VOICE I might be willing to bend the rules and let you enjoy your moment of fame. Set the phone down without hanging up... and take a step or two outside. Just for a minute. Then come straight back in or I\\'ll be forced to provide \\'live\\' coverage that should rival the historic Zapruder footage. (beat) Nothing like an exploding head to excite viewer interest. STU No, thanks. I\\'ll stay where I am. VOICE It was only a suggestion. Since you\\'re convinced I\\'m going to plug you anyway, it can\\'t matter much. STU If you shoot me, you give yourself away. VOICE Even without a muffler, they\\'d never hear the report with all this noise. Afterwards, it\\'d take them a good ten minutes to realize you weren\\'t plugged by some overzealous officer. Then they\\'ll blame the media for inciting a crackpot vigilante to come down here and do the SWAT team\\'s job for them. STU You expected them to come. You had this all worked out. VOICE I write the scenario and you all play your parts -- as directed. The damned cell phone starts beeping again. Stu fights the temptation to grab for it and hear Kelly\\'s voice for one last time. STU Poor Kelly. What she must be going through. VOICE Why don\\'t you tell her how you feel about her? STU I\\'d never get the words out. Not with fifteen or twenty rounds in me. VOICE You can\\'t be certain they\\'d fire. They\\'d see it was only a phone. STU They wouldn\\'t wait to see. The cellular ringing continues jangling Stu\\'s nerves. STU Why doesn\\'t she hang up? Then Stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across the street behind the police barricades. Countless faces rubbernecking, probably hoping to see some display of violence that would end with him face down dead on the pavement. And in the midst of them -- one face familiar to him. A female, quite pretty... even in tears. It\\'s Kelly. (We see her only in LONG SHOT -- a distant figure in bright green jacket that makes her stand out from the crowd.) STU It\\'s her! She\\'s not calling me. She\\'s over there. VOICE Is she? STU The blonde girl in the green jacket. VOICE Can\\'t miss her. Very attractive, isn\\'t she? STU She must\\'ve heard all the commotion and come downstairs. The cellular is still ringing. STU It\\'s somebody else who knows my cell number. (beat) It\\'s you! VOICE You continue to impress. STU Why is it so important that they kill me? VOICE Because that\\'s how I win. STU This time you won\\'t. If you want me dead, you\\'ll have to do it yourself. VOICE Either way I can\\'t lose. STU It\\'s all a game to you -- because you\\'re incapable of feelings. You\\'re not even human. VOICE I pride myself on that. What\\'s so great about being human? It\\'s the lowest form of life on this planet and I\\'ve taken it upon myself to thin the herd. STU I quit. I\\'m not answering back any more. I won\\'t hang up but I\\'m not playing. There\\'s silence now between them. VOICE Stu? Stu, don\\'t be that way. You\\'re taking the pleasure out of it. Stu doesn\\'t take the bait. He remains absolutely silent. A stalemate has been reached. WE RACK FOCUS ACROSS THE STREET TO THE POLICE clustered behind an emergency vehicle. The Sergeant brings a civilian to meet Captain Ramey of the SWAT unit. The newcomer wears coveralls stenciled \"AT&T.\" (Although they are very far away, we hear their voices close up as they come into sharper focus.) SERGEANT This here\\'s Helfand, of New York Telephone. HELFAND Glad to help out. RAMEY Have you got the number of that booth? HELFAND Sure do. RAMEY Can you tap into that call? HELFAND It can be done. SERGEANT But not without a warrant. You could be violating this psycho\\'s civil rights. Especially if he\\'s on the line with his fucking psychiatrist. RAMEY Shit. I don\\'t want to blow this on a technicality. Tracing the call isn\\'t any violation, is it? SERGEANT As long as we don\\'t listen in. We remain in LONG SHOT of the POLICE as they continue in heated conversation. RAMEY (to Helfand) Okay, we\\'ve got to know who he\\'s talking to and their current location. HELFAND That I can handle. As long as they keep the circuit open. RAMEY I need the number and an address to go with it. Helfand rushes off. At the corner, we can glimpse him entering a phone company utility truck parked on Forty-Fifth Street. RACK FOCUS BACK TO PHONE BOOTH Stu remains tight lipped and silent, refusing to give his tormentor the conversation he so craves. VOICE Stuart, my friend. Do you want to see how close I can come without actually hitting you? Stu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more powerful. There\\'s no glass in the left side of the booth since the late Leon smashed it all out. Nothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot. VOICE May I call attention to the yellow pages? The frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the telephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit. There\\'s been no sound of a gunshot, but the damage is there to behold. Stu reaches for the phonebook. There\\'s a bullet hole straight through it. Pieces of the .30 calibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are imbedded between the pages, half-way through the thick volume. Stu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory. He looks at them in the palm of his hand. VOICE Hollow points are designed to break up on impact. It would\\'ve behaved differently if it had pierced your soft flesh. The pieces would\\'ve bounced around looking for a way out. That\\'s where the real damage occurs -- finding an exit -- deflecting off all that bone... Stu wants to shout \"STOP,\" but restrains himself. Not talking gives him some degree of power. VOICE Still the silent treatment? My father used to dish that out when he chose to punish me. Not a word spoken -- one time for over a month. I\\'d try and goad him to acknowledge I existed, but he stared right through me. You\\'re bringing back unhappy childhood, Stu. That\\'s not wise. Stu still declines to answer. His silence seems his only weapon. He tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto the pavement. VOICE Since you\\'re ignoring me, I\\'ll focus on someone else. (a beat) There she is -- nice and sharp. I can see the two little punctures in each earlobe and my God, what kind of a girl would have her nostril pierced? Stu realizes the sniper now has Kelly in his sights. STU No! VOICE What was that? Louder, Stu. We must have a bad connection. STU Leave her out of it. VOICE I didn\\'t expect her to show up here. But since she has -- I\\'ll improvise. STU Don\\'t. Please don\\'t. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m talking to you again. I\\'ll talk all you want! VOICE It\\'s a bad dye job. The black roots are growing in and it makes her look cheap. STU I\\'ve screwed up her life enough already. Please don\\'t hurt her. VOICE I don\\'t necessarily have to kill her. I could be persuaded to settle for a reasonable mutilation. Which part of her displeases you most? If she turns a bit more in profile, I\\'m accurate enough to remove the tip of her unpleasantly protruding nose. It\\'s just cartilage. Any decent cosmetic surgeon will have her looking better than ever. STU\\'S POV - FOCUS SHIFTS TO KELLY in the crowd. Distant yet distinct amongst the curious onlookers. JUMP CUT CLOSER ON KELLY -- OBLIVIOUS TO HER DANGER. AS SEEN THROUGH CROSS HAIRS OF TELESCOPIC SIGHT following her as she forces her way through the crowd toward the police officers. Her face virtually fills the screen. PRODUCTION NOTE: The only time we deviate from Stu and his POV is when we see the sniper\\'s own POV through his telescopic sight. VOICE You can see her talking to the police now. She\\'s identifying herself as your wife. They\\'re very interested in who you are. They\\'re taking her over to see the officer in charge. What was his name? SNIPER\\'S POV Through the cross hairs of the sniperscope, we can see Kelly conversing with Captain Ramey. She\\'s in a state of complete agitation. ANGLE ON STU half leaning out of the booth, staring at his wife and the cops in the distance. RACK FOCUS TO THEM -- and suddenly we can hear them clearly in spite of the distance. KELLY What do you mean psychiatrist? He doesn\\'t see any psychiatrist. RAMEY Then who\\'d your husband be talking to? KELLY There was some guy that called the house this morning and said weird stuff to me. RAMEY Stu seems to be checking things out with this person. KELLY He hasn\\'t got many friends -- I can tell you that. RAMEY Remain here, please. We may need you later. KELLY You won\\'t hurt him? RAMEY We\\'ll do our best not to. Kelly is left alone as the Captain returns to their command center. Kelly is once again a solitary target. She could be picked off without attracting undue attention. VOICE She won\\'t even feel it when it happens. BACK TO PHONE BOOTH STU Take me instead. VOICE Don\\'t distract me. Now\\'s the time to be absolutely still. I have to hold my breath as I squeeze gently -- STU No! I\\'m hanging up. That\\'s it. Stu hangs up the receiver. He disconnects. RACK FOCUS TO LONG SHOT -- The police as they react. We see a flurry of activity across the street. Voices become clear as focus shifts. RAMEY Shit. He hung up. SERGEANT Maybe they already traced it. Anyhow, it doesn\\'t matter. Looks like he\\'s coming out. RACK FOCUS BACK TO STU -- slowly stepping out of the booth. His hands are raised. STU (shouts) I\\'ve giving myself up. Take me! SWAT OFFICER (distant) First the gun. We want to see you toss away your weapon! STU Shit. I can\\'t. SWAT OFFICER (distant) Freeze where you are! Turn around and keep those hands clasped. (signals the others) Take him. The SWAT OFFICERS in protective gear now step out of cover and fan out as they approach the booth. TIGHTER ON STU He\\'s just outside the booth -- expecting to feel the sniper\\'s bullet go through him at any moment. Then the pay phone starts ringing. The sniper is calling back. RACK FOCUS AGAIN to the police. All the cops react. Particularly the Captain and the Sergeant. Their voices seem close up when they sharpen in focus. SERGEANT What is going on with these fucking phone calls? RAMEY (shouts) Hold your fire. Let him answer it. The SWAT team backs up but maintain their aim. SERGEANT Are you nuts? RAMEY Let them talk. He\\'s not going anywhere. (shouts) He\\'s going back inside the booth. Indeed we see Stu re-enter the battered phone booth and pick up the receiver. FOCUS RETURNS TO STU STU (into pay phone) Yeah? A strange voice begins chattering away in Spanish. Totally unintelligible to Stu. STU (into pay phone) You got the wrong number. Hang up. The voice, probably a Puerto Rican gentleman, rattles on in Spanish. STU Wrong number. Wrong number. Then the voice on the phone suddenly alters the Hispanic accent. It is the now familiar tone of his tormentor. VOICE Aw, relax, Stu. Only yanking your chain. Now can we start over? STU Those cops won\\'t wait much longer. VOICE What else can they do? They can\\'t afford to just shoot you like I can. Not with so much media coverage. Not unless you make some stupid aggressive move. (beat) The ABC Mobile Unit just rolled up. Across the street, Stu can see various TV units from local stations setting up cameras on roofs of trucks. STU Will you look at that? I must be going out over the network. Bet they\\'re pre-empting usual programming. VOICE And just think -- if you survive this, your trial will be televised. And you can try and make the world believe I ever existed. I\\'d be your only defense. STU How are they gonna prove that I killed anybody when there\\'s no gun? VOICE They\\'ll plant one. The police aren\\'t above that -- when they\\'re desperate to convict. STU No, sir. No gun and I walk. VOICE Don\\'t you think I took that into account? Am I a fool? STU What do you mean? VOICE Haven\\'t I considered every eventuality? I knew they\\'d come and cordon off the block. (beat) And that there\\'d have to be a gun someplace. STU Where? VOICE It\\'s a small booth, Stu. Have you checked every inch of it? STU (looking up and down) It\\'s not on the floor. VOICE Then what\\'s left? STU Up above. VOICE Could be. Why don\\'t you reach up there and lift the plastic sheet -- and feel around. STU If they see me reach for something, they could open fire. VOICE They could. But you have to know if it\\'s there. Don\\'t you? STU I totally don\\'t give a shit. VOICE In a narrow space, tucked just to the left of the fluorescent bulb. You can almost see it outlined if you look closely. Stu peers upward at the clouded plastic, now stained and dirty. There are shadows of objects above in the shallows area around the light fixture that automatically goes on when the door to the phone booth is tightly closed. Stu opens and closes the door a few times, watching the light click on -- watching the shadows around the light. Could that be an accumulation of dirt, dust, or dead insects? Or could something be stashed up there? STU It doesn\\'t matter. I know about ballistics. The slug in that dead guy came from your rifle, not any handgun. VOICE You saw how hollow points splinter on impact. There\\'s nothing much for ballistics to match to. The same make .30 calibre bullets are in that handgun. The prosecution rests. STU There\\'s no gun up there. I don\\'t see a damn thing. VOICE Slide your finger up under the plastic and you\\'ll feel the cold metal surface. There are four rounds left in it. Should you decide to shoot your way out. STU I could never shoot anybody. VOICE You could shoot me, Stu. You\\'d do that in a minute if you could. STU And I\\'d fucking love it! VOICE Now you\\'re speaking from the heart. Come on, just lift the partition a few inches and feel what\\'s there for you. STU I\\'m not getting my fingerprints on your fucking weapon. What about powder residue? How are they going to explain that to a jury? VOICE Do you think that\\'ll matter with so many eye witnesses? (beat) Do it... or should I re-focus my attention on Kelly? STU No. VOICE You carefully distracted me from her before and I let you get away with it. But if you\\'re not going to play fairly -- (a pause) There she is again. So close I feel like I could touch her. STU Get off her! VOICE Then mind me when I speak. STU Look! I\\'m reaching up with my left hand. I\\'m pushing against the partition. It\\'s giving. I\\'m feeling around with my fingertips. It\\'s filthy up there. TIGHT SHOT - STU\\'S FINGERS feel about inside the shallow space. The shriveled remains of dead flies -- a layer of dust -- and then a .30 handgun. STU I\\'m -- touching something. VOICE One of the finest handguns Remington makes. Lightweight, efficient and highly accurate. STU I\\'m not picking it up. VOICE Not right now. But eventually... Stu lowers his hand, still empty. STU I wouldn\\'t have a chance. VOICE I never said you would. STU I\\'m not insane. VOICE But you\\'re getting there. It wouldn\\'t take much. STU That won\\'t happen. VOICE You could pull the gun down, shove it in your own mouth and jerk the trigger. That\\'s another option. STU Why would I do that? VOICE To please me. And ensure that nothing happens to Kelly. I don\\'t necessarily have to deal with her today in the midst of a crowd of cops. I can take her out any time I like. When she goes to pull down her blinds at night or when she walks the dog first thing in the morning. What is it -- a Jack Russell? STU Okay. I know you can do it. But don\\'t talk about that. Please. VOICE I\\'d rather see you remembered as the gallant gunman who tried to shoot his way past an army of police -- than as a coward who sucked the barrel. I\\'m doing your PR for you. Creating a final image that\\'ll endure. The outraged New Yorker who was pushed too far. When some lowlife street person tries to invade his territory, he retaliated. And when the forces of the law closed in, he was defiant... to the end. STU Like that nerdy sonofabitch who blew those three wiseass kids away on the subway? VOICE Exactly. Nobody minded that he was a sicko. He was living out a New Yorker\\'s pet fantasy. Can you remember that movie where Peter Finch started screaming \\'I\\'m not taking it anymore!\\' And everybody picked up on it. STU \\'I\\'m mad as hell and I\\'m not taking it anymore.\\' VOICE That was it. Poor Finch got himself an Oscar for that. But he was dead by then. I mean he really died. Maybe playing that part took too much out of him. STU (softly to himself) \\'I\\'m not taking it anymore.\\' \\'I\\'m not taking it anymore.\\' VOICE That\\'s the way! Psyche yourself up. Everybody respects a man who fights back, even if he goes a little berserk in the process. STU Fighting back. That\\'s what it\\'s about. VOICE Exactly! We all understand the poor schmuck that gets laid off and comes back and shoots all his bosses. We all thought of doing that. But only he had the balls. The terminally ill husband who gets his policy canceled and machine guns the insurance company offices. Maybe somebody will finally get the message. You can fuck human beings over only for so long before they come back at you. I\\'m still holding on Kelly and she looks very concerned. I could relieve all that anguish in a fraction of a second. Shall I? Stu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man on the line has done to him. His turn has come to fight back. He has an idea. If the sniper is focused on Kelly, he can\\'t be watching Stu. Turning his back to the police, Stu slowly sinks to his knees. STU I\\'m on my knees begging you. VOICE Stand up, Stu. You\\'re embarrassing yourself. TIGHT ANGLE -- Stu now down on his knees in the booth. He\\'s curled up almost into a fetal position. By doing so, he hopes to hide the fact that he\\'s reaching into his pants pocket and pulling out his cellular phone. He half expects to hear a shot ring out either from the sniper or the cops. But nothing happens. VOICE Stu -- I want you back on your feet facing me. So you can see what I\\'m going to do to her. Stu ignores the command. He\\'s quickly dialing. 911. He\\'s calling police emergency. SNIPER\\'S POV Stu seen through the cross hairs of the sniperscope, crouched, doubled up at the foot of the booth. But the cell phone is hidden in front of him. VOICE Be a man, Stuart. Don\\'t let them see you like this. You\\'re an embarrassment to me. WIDER SHOT - THE BOOTH with Stu still kneeling. RACK FOCUS to police across the street as their voices become clear -- SERGEANT (listening to transmission) Officer on east side of the street reports subject removed a dark metallic object from his pocket. We better move. RAMEY Hold all fire until you actually identify a weapon. We\\'re doing this on fucking TV! RACK FOCUS BACK TO -- STU IN THE BOOTH crouched forward. The pay phone receiver dangles just above his head. The cellular remains cupped in his hand. Stu never lifts the cell phone. He keeps the palm of his hand over the speaker of the phone to muffle any sound from the other end. It rings and finally someone answers. EMERGENCY OPERATOR (faint) Police. Is this an emergency? Hello? Is someone on the line? But Stu addresses himself loudly to the pay phone which he now grips in his other hand. Hoping that his words will be picked up by the emergency operator listening via the cellular. To help in this regard, he reaches back and slides the door to the booth tightly closed. He pretends to be talking to the sniper but his words are meant for the 911 operator to hear. STU (loud) You\\'ve made your point. Who\\'s going to believe I\\'ve got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in a fucking phone booth at 45th and 8th? VOICE It took you a while to believe it yourself. STU If you\\'d put a bullet in that Captain Ramey, it would\\'ve been a different story -- but you were too wise to do that. VOICE Why don\\'t you do it for me? Wave the old captain back over and get him nice and close and then use the handgun on him. STU (talking loud) Why me? You could pick off any of those cops from your window up there. Like you did that pimp. And that tourist last week. But this time you want me to do your killing for you. VOICE And you will! To save Kelly. EXTREME TIGHT SHOT - CELL PHONE cupped in Stu\\'s hand and held low. Can they hear him on the other end? EMERGENCY OPERATOR (muffled, almost inaudible) Can you speak up, sir? What is your name? Stu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the emergency operator. He sets the cell phone down flat on the floor of the booth facing upward. He puts his foot over the receiving end to muffle the incoming voice. Then he stands up. VOICE That\\'s better, Stu. Now turn around so I can see you. Stu talks close into the pay phone receiver now. But keeps his voice raised. STU This booth. It\\'s my whole world -- shrunk down to four feet by three feet. Not much bigger than the size of a coffin. VOICE They can put handles on the booth and bury you in it. STU (loudly into pay phone) When I saw you put that bullet into that black dude, I knew you\\'d never let me out of this phone booth alive. VOICE You\\'re wasting my time. Reach up and take the gun. STU (peering upward, squinting) Let me see you first. What harm can that do you? You\\'re in one of those windows. I\\'ve got to know which one. VOICE No need for that. STU Being so far, I could never identify you. I don\\'t even want to. VOICE What is it then? STU Don\\'t worry that I\\'d try to point you out. You\\'d shut me up with one of your .30 calibre hollow points before I could even raise a finger. VOICE Why does it matter so much? STU I want to see that you exist. Like God exists. It\\'s not enough to believe. You want to see him -- just once -- even at a distance. VOICE And then you\\'d take the gun down. And use it. We have a deal on that? STU Show yourself to me and I\\'ll take the gun down. I swear. There\\'s a pause as the sniper mulls it over. VOICE I don\\'t have to make deals. And you\\'re irritating me by trying to negotiate. God doesn\\'t have to prove anything. He just strikes you down when he gets in the mood. STU Stop! I won\\'t ask to see you anymore. VOICE I\\'m glad that\\'s settled. But look who else has showed up? STU Who? VOICE I guess she saw the coverage on TV and just couldn\\'t keep away. STU What are you talking about? VOICE The \\'hotel\\' just arrived. And a very beautiful little hotel she is. Actually, I\\'d classify her as more of a motel. STU Mavis? I don\\'t see her. VOICE She\\'s too far back behind the police line. But I\\'ve got a fine shot at her from up here. STU You don\\'t even know what she looks like. VOICE You\\'re in an enviable position now, Stu. You get to choose between them. Tell me which one. STU I can\\'t. VOICE Which will it be? Kelly or Mavis? Or should I simply select one? INSERT SHOT - THE CELL PHONE lying face up on the floor of the booth. Is anybody listening? BACK TO STU Stu looks down at the cellular. He has no way of knowing if the police operator can hear any of his words. STU I need time to think... VOICE You\\'ve got to be more in touch with your feelings. You said you love Kelly. STU I do. VOICE Then I\\'m doing you a favor putting you out of the way of temptation. STU It wasn\\'t Mavis\\' fault. It was all my fault. VOICE Then take the third option. Reach above you and pick up the gun. STU You\\'ll leave them both alone? VOICE There won\\'t be much point in harming them without you around to impress. STU I\\'ll do it. VOICE Let me see you do it. STU I need one minute. One last minute, please. Can you give me that? VOICE Don\\'t tell me you\\'re going to say your prayers? STU Something like that. WE RACK FOCUS AWAY TO LONG SHOT - THE POLICE assembled on the opposite side of the street. RAMEY They should\\'ve traced the fucking call by now. SERGEANT (listening on transmitter) There\\'s something else coming in. A 911 operator says your name was mentioned by somebody that\\'s still on the line. Somebody talking about a phone booth. And a sniper. RAMEY Patch me through. Hello, this is Captain Edward Ramey. What about that call? EMERGENCY OPERATOR The line is still open. It\\'s originating from a booth at 45th and 8th. RAMEY We\\'re there! Can you play me back your recording of the entire call? EMERGENCY OPERATOR I can\\'t replay the tape while it\\'s still running. RAMEY Then switch to another machine and play back what you\\'ve got. EMERGENCY OPERATOR It\\'s awful faint. He\\'s not talking directly into the receiver. Ramey begins to listen. We hear snatches of Stu\\'s call picking up words which are at times incomprehensible. STU\\'S VOICE (faint) \\'Who\\'s going to believe I\\'ve got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in some fucking phone booth...\\' The uniformed TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN now joins Ramey and the Sergeant. TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN Got what you wanted. The call\\'s coming from up the street. The Hotel Broadway. RAMEY Have you got the room? TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN It\\'s not that easy. Electronic switchboard. RAMEY (to Sergeant) Move your SWAT units to the hotel. No... wait. Any movement will alert the sniper. If he sees any of us withdraw, he may panic. SERGEANT There\\'s another SWAT unit on the way. RAMEY Intercept them. Divert them to the hotel. SERGEANT It\\'s done. RAMEY Send them in from the Forty-third Street side. I don\\'t want any activity the sniper might catch sight of. He\\'s probably high up and facing that booth. He\\'s got to continue to believe our full attention is focused on the man inside -- whoever the hell that poor bastard is. (to emergency operator) Hello 911 operator, I missed some of that. Run it halfway back and repeat it. STU\\'S VOICE (REPLAY) (faint) \\'... Like you did that pimp. And that tourist last week. But this time you want me to do the killing for you...\\' RAMEY (listening) Jesus... he\\'s a dead man. BACK INSIDE PHONE BOOTH VOICE The police seem all excited about something, Stu. STU Are they? I wasn\\'t looking. VOICE I can\\'t wait any longer. Say amen, then reach up for the gun. When your hand comes down, I want to see it. STU I\\'m too afraid. VOICE For once, be brave. Surprise yourself. STU I\\'m shaking all over. VOICE Guys in combat situations even shit their pants. But they follow orders. STU As soon as the cops see a gun, they\\'ll open fire. VOICE Then I\\'d advise you to fire first. Stu\\'s arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower. His fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that cover the roof of the booth. It raises up easily at the middle where two sheets join. TIGHT INSERT SHOT The space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of clouded plastic. We see the fluorescent lighting fixture covered with dust. The solitary object -- a cruel-looking weapon. Now Stu\\'s fingertips protrude into the small space. He touches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the roughness of the grip. TIGHT SHOT - STU\\'S FACE as below he continues to hesitate -- it\\'s agony -- The sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed tightly shut. He can already imagine the police bullets tearing into him. A POLICE SNIPER IS MOVING INTO POSITION. POLICE SNIPER (into transmitter) Give me the word. RACK BACK TO STU - IN THE BOOTH His arm still raised. He hasn\\'t brought it down with the gun in it. Not yet. He holds the pay phone receiver jammed up against his mouth. VOICE Hard part\\'s over. Drop your arm and point it like you\\'d point your finger and squeeze. STU No. You do it. If you want me dead, then fucking murder me! VOICE Why must I keep invoking some poor girl\\'s name every time we come to an impasse? I\\'m focused back on Kelly again. You\\'re obviously not willing to trade your life for hers. STU I am! I\\'m doing it! He pulls the handgun down into full view. Curiously, the police do not open fire. STU There! You see it? They all see it. He waves the gun so nobody can miss it. STU Where are you? Damn you!! He drops the receiver and steps halfway out of the booth. Still the cops do not open fire. Then Stu starts shooting. Not at the police, but at the high rise buildings across the street. At the thousands of windows that look down upon him. He gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out in response. RACK FOCUS TO THE POLICE SNIPER He has fired. ANGLE ON STU The remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters. Stu tumbles forward, sprawling out of the booth onto the pavement. RACK FOCUS TO KELLY She screams, tries to break through but cops restrain her. INT. PHONE BOOTH ANGLE ON DANGLING RECEIVER as it sways back and forth. From it, we hear the voice. VOICE Thanks for such an interesting afternoon. THEN THERE ARE OTHER SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE DANGLING SWAYING PHONE. A wooden door being battered open. A few incomprehensible shouts as a SWAT TEAM dashes in. Stu\\'s stalling for time has paid off. THE SOUND OF A BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE. THE SOUND OF A MUFFLED SCREAM. The police have broken in on Stu\\'s tormentor and there has been a rapid exchange of shots. A HAND reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver. ANGLE WIDENS as Ramey places it to his ear. RAMEY Hello? This is Captain Ramey. Somebody talk to me. SWAT OFFICER\\'S VOICE Yeah. We took him out, Captain. Nobody else got hurt. RAMEY What\\'s his condition? SWAT OFFICER\\'S VOICE Critical. The sonofabitch took two. Probably won\\'t survive the ride. RAMEY Get a statement from him. I\\'ll be right over. He drops the receiver so that it dangles again. CAMERA FOLLOWS RAMEY to where Stu lies surrounded by cops and medics. He\\'s stunned, but very much alive. MEDIC Don\\'t try to sit up. STU What was that? RAMEY (kneeling) Rubber bullet. MEDIC You\\'ll have one hell of a nasty welt. Busted rib. Maybe a permanent scar there. STU It couldn\\'t hurt much more if you really shot me. RAMEY Somebody was going to and we thought it may as well be us. STU Did you get him? RAMEY Sure as hell did. Thanks to you. STU Still alive? RAMEY Barely. MEDIC We\\'ll be giving him a hypo for the pain. It\\'ll put him out for a while. Kelly is now brought over by a female cop. She drops to her knees beside Stu and tries to embrace him. The medics restrain her. STU It\\'s okay. I\\'m not really shot. KELLY I was so afraid. I thought... STU I thought so, too. But we\\'re going to be alright. Both of us. KELLY Remember how you swore up and down you\\'d get me on TV? Well, you did. I already got interviewed on Fox and Channel Eleven and they even want me on A.M. America tomorrow morning. STU Bet you didn\\'t think I could deliver on that. MEDIC Will you please let go of him, Miss? A gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance. The medic is about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away. STU No. No hypo. I want to see him first. The medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart him off. But Stu struggles against them. RAMEY Relax. The guy\\'s dying. STU That\\'s why I\\'ve gotta talk to him. Please! RAMEY We\\'ll see. MEDIC (to Kelly) You can ride with him in the ambulance. The woman cop escorts Kelly to the waiting ambulance. Ramey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the SWAT team inside the hotel. RAMEY This is Ramey. Over. This is Ramey. Ten-Four. There\\'s nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple garbled voices on the other end of the line. RAMEY Shit. Get everybody off this wavelength. He crosses back to the phone booth -- picks up the dangling receiver. RAMEY Hello. Hello! Pick up! Yeah, it\\'s Ramey again. Can you hold the phone close enough so the perp can listen? COP\\'S VOICE He\\'s not saying a word, Captain. RAMEY He\\'s not about to talk to us. Maybe to him. Ramey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift Stu onto the gurney. RAMEY Forget that. Stand him up. (to Stu) Can you stand? STU I can try. RAMEY Help him over here. The medics support Stu and inch him back to the booth. It\\'s painful, but Stu ignores it. Ramey holds the phone up so Stu can both listen and speak. RAMEY Here. Speak up. STU (into pay phone) It\\'s me. Do you hear me? Answer me. VOICE (wheezing) Had to have the last word, Stu. STU I finally beat your ass. Admit it, you fuck. VOICE But you\\'ll never forget me. I gave you the most thrilling day of your life. Say thanks. STU Now you\\'re gonna die, you bastard. VOICE I lost a lot of blood. Don\\'t you want to donate some for me? Then we\\'d really be part of each other. STU Hang on. I can\\'t wait to see you at the hospital. So I can yank your fucking air tube out. VOICE Wish I could give you that pleasure. You deserve it. (coughing) ... Only I\\'m out of time. STU What\\'s your name? At least tell me who you are. There\\'s more violent coughing, then silence. Then a cop\\'s voice is heard. COP\\'S VOICE He\\'s gone. Stu stares at the receiver. RAMEY Don\\'t worry. We\\'ll find out who he is. And why he picked you. STU No. You won\\'t. (a beat) What do you want to bet you won\\'t? Stu reaches over and hangs up the receiver. CLICK. STU I\\'ll spend my whole life trying to figure that out. Then he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto the waiting gurney. The hypo is finally administered. It kicks in immediately, relieving the pain. He\\'s wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance. Kelly is already inside waiting to accompany Stu to the hospital. STU\\'S POV - BEING WHEELED AWAY FROM THE EMPTY BOOTH pulling away in LOW ANGLE. CAMERA SLIDES BACK inside the ambulance with Stu. The doors shut, obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his entire world until moments ago. STU (groggy) Gotta sleep now. No phone calls... Kelly smiles down at him as the image blurs. Stu passes out -- into a deep sleep he much deserves. A SIREN BLARES. CUT TO BLACK.',\n",
       "       'SHIFTY Written by Eran Creevy 1 INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING A large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer, makes its way along a stretch of motorway. 2 INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the bridge of his nose. It\\'s no use, Chris, 25, can\\'t sleep. He pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play on his MP3. 3 INT. COACH. MORNING Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver\\'s gruff face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera, Chris\\' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music from his MP3 begin to play. It\\'s Noel McKoy\\'s \"Brighter Day\", a northern soul track that\\'s reminiscent of Motown and comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye. The track will play over the following opening scenes, the credits fading subtly in and out in white text. 4 EXT. STREET. MORNING We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to house the east end after the Second World War. CUT TO: We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up. SHIFTY Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a fence, making a short cut. 5 INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING Bird\\'s eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset, pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water, holding his nose. SIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUST CALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS. 2. 6 INT. COACH. MORNING. Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN. 7 INT. GLEN\\'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty\\'s about a kilo of cocaine onto a clean glass table. 8 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white dressing gown, prepares breakfast. 9 EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping over a fence at the end. 10 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits. 11 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation. 12 INT. COACH. MORNING Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same strip of waste land Shifty just walked across. 13 GLEN\\'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING Glen splits the cocaine into two piles. 14 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. MORNING Trevor sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. His mind is racing, thinking about the morning ahead of him. 3. 15 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING Jasmine washes away the sick with a jug of water. 16 EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING The coach pulls away to reveal Chris, his bag slung over his shoulder. A BEAT. He turns and walks off. 17 TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING Trevor looks at him self in the bathroom mirror, he rubs his face, he seems a little more with it. 18 INT. GLEN\\'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING Glen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one half of the cocaine. He mixes it carefully. 19 EXT. REZ\\'S HOUSE / BACK GARDEN. MORNING Shifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house. 20 EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. DAY Chris makes his way through the streets, bag slung over his shoulder. He looks around at the old place. Soaking it in. 21 INT. GLEN\\'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING Glen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes it with citric acid. He sucks it up into a syringe. 22 EXT. REZ\\'S HOUSE . MORNING Shifty quietly opens the back door to the house. 23 INT. GLEN\\'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. MORNING Glen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad facial burns on the side of her face. He injects the cocaine mix into her arm. She lays back on the bed, taking on the rush. 4. 24 EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING Chris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of paper with a scribbled address. He finds the right house. He stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3. Our soulful soundtrack comes to an end. He pulls down his head phones, walks to the door and knocks gently. 25 INT. REZ\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING Shifty stands at the table sorting through letters. He hears the knock and walks to open it. He takes off his jacket, puts it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris. SHIFTY Fucking hell, man... Shifty can\\'t help but smile. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) You\\'re early! CHRIS Shifty. A smile creeps across Chris\\' face. SHIFTY Yes, rude boy. CHRIS You alright geezer. SHIFTY I\\'m sweet... come in, man, come in. Shifty and Chris embrace. CHRIS Good to see you, mate. SHIFTY Good to see you too, geezer. 26 INT. REZ\\'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING CLOSE ON: WATER GUSHES FROM A TAP. Chris stands splashing his face from the sink. His bag perched on the cistern. He looks at himself in the mirror. 5. 27 INT. REZ\\'S HOUSE / SHIFTY\\'S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING Chris walks into Shifty\\'s bedroom. He puts down his bag and pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD\\'s, CD\\'s, lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side, books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked pile of mobile phone bills with the word \"PAID\" scribed across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He stands, staring. 28 INT. REZ\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING Chris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast ready. Shifty turns to face him. SHIFTY You alright son? CHRIS Yeah I just needed to splash my face, freshen up a bit. SHIFTY Have you slept? CHRIS Did I fuck. SHIFTY Mate, neither have I... I just got back from some girls yard. CHRIS You got a bird? SHIFTY No, no... just some fucking booty call. CHRIS What, Break Glass Arse? SHIFTY In case of emergency\\'s, man... you know it. They both laugh. Shifty lays sausages into a pan. CHRIS She fit? SHIFTY What! 6. CHRIS She fit? SHIFTY Yeah, she\\'s alright you know.... She\\'s got fucking massive Gary\\'s. Chris laughs. CHRIS You always loved your titties, bruv. SHIFTY You know that! Shifty lays sausages into a sizzling pan. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) Mate, do you mind halal? CHRIS No, no, that\\'s sweet mate, whatever. A BEAT. SHIFTY Were you on just one bus? CHRIS Yeah... no sorry, two. I had to change at Luton. SHIFTY LUTON! CHRIS Yeah, man. SHIFTY Fucking random. Shifty covers the sausages with a lid. We hear someone moving about upstairs. Shifty quickly walks over to the freezer, opens the door, reaches into the back and pulls out a large bag of sweet corn. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) I\\'ve got a few things to do today geezer, you can stay here if you want, just chill out. He rummages about, and gradually, one by one, pulls out tightly, cellophane-wrapped bags of coke and crack. He places them in the pockets of his hooded top. Chris watches Shifty closely, but doesn\\'t say anything. 7. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) Or you can come with me? CHRIS Whatever. A BEAT. CHRIS (CONT\\'D) (whispers) Does your brother know you keep those there? Shifty shakes his head. CHRIS (CONT\\'D) (Whispering) You not worried? SHIFTY Mate, he doesn\\'t eat vegetables. Shifty walks past Chris and taps reassuringly him on the arm. WE STAY ON CHRIS\\' FACE, AS HE TAKES IT IN. SHIFTY (O.S.) (CONT\\'D) Apart from in a pot noodle. 29 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / STAIRWELL / KITCHEN. MORNING We follow Trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and walks into a large, smartly decked kitchen, an eight-year-old boy, Freddie, circles the kitchen-table smashing a Darth Vader into passing stools. Katie a three year old baby girl eats breakfast and Jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst talking on the phone. JASMINE (on phone) ... she\\'s living like a drifter babe, I\\'m telling you, she\\'s split... sort of... with Stefan... I know she did... but she stays at Mike\\'s in the week, and then she\\'s back at Stefan\\'s at the weekend... with the kids (to baby) Katie, darling, stop banging your bowl... Trevor considers the bowl of cereal and fruit juice laid out for him. His stomach churns. Cold sweat smothers his brow. 8. JASMINE (CONT\\'D) (on phone) ...Neither knows about the other, and then she expects me (she drops to a whisper) to fucking cover for her (normal volume) Stefan\\'s my mate for Christ\\'s sake, I\\'m not getting caught up in that whole mess (to boy) Freddie, sit down and finish your breakfast! This is too much for Trevor. He turns and walks away from the table. JASMINE (CONT\\'D) (on phone) ... and she has a go at me for taking on too much (she laughs - then without looking up) Babe, I\\'m cooking you some eggs... SLAM - the front door crashes shut - he\\'s gone - his breakfast untouched. JASMINE (CONT\\'D) Oh... what... nothing, Trevor\\'s just walked out without touching his breakfast... I don\\'t know, I thought so anyway... 30 EXT. DRIVEWAY. MORNING Silence. Trevor soaks it in - deep breaths - panic subsiding. He approaches his work van. \"T. PALMER - BUILDER\\'S MERCHANT\" inscribed on the side. He gets in - suddenly his mobile rings - he answers. JASMINE What\\'s the matter? Off screen Katie continues to bash her bowl on the tray. TREVOR Nothing, I\\'m fine. JASMINE Why didn\\'t you say good-bye? TREVOR You were gassing away to Nicola... JASMINE And why didn\\'t you touch your breakfast? 9. TREVOR I\\'m not hungry. Off Screen Freddie yells. JASMINE What\\'s the matter with you? TREVOR I\\'m fine. She runs the tap, water gushes on to the discarded eggs. JASMINE Where\\'s the grey suitcase? TREVOR What? I can\\'t hear you babe. JASMINE I want to start getting stuff ready for next week - where\\'s the grey suitcase? TREVOR I\\'ll find it when I get home. JASMINE It\\'s all right babe I\\'ll get it. TREVOR Jasmine, I\\'ll get it when I get home. JASMINE Babe it\\'s fine, I\\'ll get it down. TREVOR (Stern) I\\'LL FIND THE FUCKING THING WHEN I GET HOME. CLICK! He breathes in hard, takes a moment to calm down and then starts the engine. 31 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. MORNING Jasmine drops the phone by her side, shocked at Trevor\\'s temperament, and watches through the front room window as he drives away. 10. 32 INT. SHIFTY\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING Shifty\\'s laying out the breakfast. At that moment, Rez, Shifty\\'s brother, walks in. Mid 30\\'s, portly. He sees Chris. REZ (PAKISTANI - SUBTITLED) Motherfucker, the return of the white man. Chris stands and goes to embrace Rez, but Rez walks past and grabs a glass of orange juice from the side. CHRIS How you doing Rez, good to see you, man? REZ I wondered why I could hear voices. I thought he\\'d brought home a rent boy again. SHIFTY Shut up you prick. REZ (To Chris) You look like a rent boy. CHRIS What are you talking about? Points at Chris. REZ That top cost more than my education. CHRIS My pants cost more than your education. REZ (sings) Cold blooded. Shifty lays down three plates of breakfast. Rez fakes a heart attack. SHIFTY (PAKISTANI) Soak it in fat boy. CHRIS I take it this doesn\\'t happen often. 11. REZ You know what, I\\'m emotional, where\\'s my camera, bring me my camera. Quick, man, quick. SHIFTY Yeah, fucking laugh it up. REZ (PAKISTANI) Don\\'t worry I will. Shifty sits down and they begin their food. 33 EXT. TREVOR\\'S VAN. MORNING Trevor sits at the wheel, parked in a residential street. He dials a number on his mobile but gets the following message (V.O.) This number is currently unavailable please try agai... He puts down the phone, and sits there, waiting, agitated. 34 INT. REZ\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING. All three of them eat in silence. Chris\\' eyes dart occasionally to Rez who pays no attention to anything but the food. There is an uncomfortable air in the room. 35 INT. TREVORS\\'S VAN. MORNING Trevor does a line of cocaine of the tip of his car key. We see that he doesn\\'t have a huge amount left in his wrap. 36 INT. REZ\\'S HOUSE/KITCHEN. MORNING Shifty\\'s putting away breakfast, Chris and Rez sit at the table.

A BEAT. CHRIS I dunno. Not really. He\\'s lying. REZ (to Shifty) I told you I haven\\'t put on that much weight. Shifty lets out a sarcastic laugh. REZ (CONT\\'D) How long since you\\'ve been back?

SHIFTY Rachel Price. REZ Who? SHIFTY Mate, Rachel and Serena. Rez pauses, thinking. Chris clocks him with an almost icy stare. REZ Oh right. Chris looks back down at his magazine. Rez knows he hit a raw nerve. An uncomfortable silence. Shifty tries to break the ice by talking about a more trivial topic. SHIFTY (to Rez) You remember Rachel, you fucking lunged her at Jazzbo Browns? 15. REZ WHAT... that\\'s BULLSHIT. CHRIS Yeah, yeah, you went in for the kill and she lent away like she was doing the fucking limbo. Chris is back in the conversation. SHIFTY Her ponytail swept the floor. Shifty and Chris touch fists. REZ You boys need to get your facts straight... she fucking lunged me. CHRIS You couldn\\'t even remember who she was five minutes ago. Shifty and Chris crack up laughing. SHIFTY (to Chris) I wouldn\\'t mind if he did it discreetly, but he lunged her from about three feet. Shifty mimics Rez\\'s historic lunge, Rez starts to laugh at the memory of it, covering his face with his hands. 37 INT. TREVOR\\'S VAN.

Echoing through the house. CUT TO: She dabs finger with tongue, her face sours. She was almost hoping she was wrong. CUT TO: Freddie laughs as his car smashes into another opponent.

GLEN Lenny\\'s got it. * As Shifty walks to the car he discreetly backhands a roll of * money to Glen. Seated in the driver\\'s seat sits Lenny, a frail man, eyes sunken, hair thinning. His denim jacket giving him the only dignity from looking like a walking corpse. Seated next to him is Loretta. She\\'s pulling out a crack pipe itching to take a hit. Shifty leans through the window and in one swift move takes a package from Lenny, slipping it into his jacket, and drops a pile of cash into his lap. SHIFTY Alright Lenny? LENNY Alright mate.

Glen laughs at his own joke. Chris looks furious. Shifty walks back over. SHIFTY Come! GLEN Right you done? (Shifty nods) Good. (MORE) 26. GLEN (CONT\\'D) (he takes a final drag on his fag) Don\\'t go blowing up any fucking tube trains. Glen walks back to the car. Chris throws Shifty a look and storms off, Shifty follows after him. 58 INT. LENNY\\'S CAR. DAY Viewing the action from the dashboard we see Glen enter the rear door. Loretta, puffing away on a crack pipe, passes it to Lenny. GLEN What are we waiting for? LENNY Give me a fucking break I\\'m rushing my tits off... Lenny attempts to start the car. LENNY (CONT\\'D) Where\\'s the keys babe? LORETTA Let\\'s just go Lenny. I\\'m freaking out.

TREVOR Bob. Bob ignores him. TREVOR (CONT\\'D) Bob I need this money. Bob stays quiet, approaches a workman and starts talking to him. Trevor stands behind them. TREVOR (CONT\\'D) Bob! Bob turns to him, and puts out his hand. BOB Thank\\'s for coming today Trevor, we\\'ll definitely be in touch. Bob\\'s hand hangs there. Trevor looks at him, to the hand. Bob turns away and carries on talking. Trevor stands for a moment then turns and walks away. Trevor\\'s face is awash with emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it together. 61 EXT. HILL TOP. DAY Shifty and Chris sit atop of a hill looking out across a skate park - The camera observing them from behind. Shifty hands Chris a rolled spliff.

REZ\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY Rez carries a bundle of dirty clothes to the washing machine and clumsily throws them in. He pulls out the powder tray but it comes out completely from the machine. REZ FUCK! He tries to wedge it back in but it doesn\\'t want to go. Rez gets down on his knees and tries again, to no avail. He looks in the gap, and sees something. 30. He sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around. He has something; slowly Rez pulls out a large, see-through, watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack. Rez sits back against the machine just staring at it. 64 EXT. HILL TOP. DAY Shifty and Chris just sit. Suddenly Chris notices something. CHRIS What\\'s that? SHIFTY What? Chris points.

They\\'re both cracking up laughing, loving it. 66 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN / BATHROOM. DAY On Jasmine\\'s kitchen floor, just outside the connecting bathroom, are stacked a variety of toiletry goods. The sounds of scrubbing and movement echo out. Jasmine, her dressing gown grubby and soaked, cleanses, scrubs, and cleans the emptied bathroom like a woman possessed. She\\'s purging her haven, washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum. 31. WE CUT TO A LONG SHOT, OVER FREDDIE\\'S SHOULDER TO SEE HIM WATCHING HER. 67 EXT. VALERIE\\'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY. A fairly respectable but featureless tenement block looms. 68 INT. VALERIE\\'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS/CORRIDOR. DAY Shifty and Chris stand before a racing green door upon which a small ceramic emblem of a cat nestles under the number eight. Shifty knocks on the door. Silence. He stares at the emblem of the cat. SHIFTY Fucking cat lovers. A BEAT. CHRIS I can\\'t stand people who feed their cat\\'s... fucking red snapper... or goose liver, because they say the fucking things fussy... A BEAT. CHRIS (CONT\\'D) ...it\\'s a fucking cat.

Shifty bends down and looks through the letterbox. He sees a shadow approaching. He stands back up. The latch snaps, echoing down the clinical looking hallway. 69 * INT. VALERIE\\'S FLAT / HALLWAY. DAY We follow Shifty through a corridor deprived of light and colour. Valerie, who leads the way, is considerably smaller. We open into the front room and Valerie\\'s revealed for the first time. At 5\\'5\" with long arms book-ended by bony hands and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing Goth and is clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by LSD. Sleeping cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards. A BEAT. Valerie looks towards Chris. SHIFTY Valerie, this is Chris, he\\'s erm, he\\'s an old friend of mine, we grew up together. He\\'s cool. We go way back. So it\\'s cool, you know. CHRIS How you doing? He offers a hand that she takes politely. VALERIE Yeah. Hi. A moment of uncomfortable silence. SHIFTY I called yesterday but you were out. VALERIE When? SHIFTY I dunno, It was probably about two in the afternoon. VALERIE I was in all day. A BEAT. SHIFTY You must have been asleep. 33. VALERIE No, no I was awake, I didn\\'t sleep. A BEAT. SHIFTY I dunno then. VALERIE Did you say two o\\'clock. SHIFTY Yeah. VALERIE Are you sure it wasn\\'t two thirty. A BEAT.

SHIFTY Yeah, that\\'ll be sweet. 70 * INT. VALERIE\\'S FRONT ROOM. DAY Chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days, fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He looks slightly shocked to see this. CUT TO: Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room. He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all the cats in the room are stuffed. 34. Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the wall. It\\'s so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat ornaments rattle. 71 * INT. VALERIE\\'S KITCHEN. DAY Valerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the counter top. SHIFTY How you been, alright. VALERIE Yeah, I\\'m alright babe, you alright? SHIFTY Yeah, I\\'m alright. VALERIE Good, good. Silence as Valerie prepares the tea. SHIFTY She visited you yet? VALERIE No... not for a long time, Shifty... not seen her for a long time really, darling. Shifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He places a hand on her arm. SHIFTY She\\'ll come back one day. They carry on making the tea. 72 * INT. VALERIE\\'S FRONT ROOM. DAY The drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink. Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can\\'t believe what he\\'s seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by the music. 35. We\\'re tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some. CHRIS No, no, I\\'m fine......thanks though. CLOSE ON SHIFTY. SHIFTY Look Val we\\'re gonna have to do one... THE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TO SHIFTY... Shifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly unsettled by what he\\'s seen. 73 * EXT. OUTSIDE VALERIE\\'S FLAT. DAY Shifty shuts the door to Valerie\\'s behind him. They go to walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks. He pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried on walking. SHIFTY Geezer, give me a minute. Chris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his jacket. Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to unhook the latch. The door swings slowly open, the drum \\'n\\' bass booming out. 73A * INT. OTIS\\' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY Shifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We\\'re introduced to a dark hallway, clothes, magazines and CD\\'s litter the floor. Shifty peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway - a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old, Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty, cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed. Shifty stares him out. 36. * SHIFTY Alright mate? OTIS Alright. Shifty looks about at the room. SHIFTY What\\'s your name? OTIS Otis. A BEAT. SHIFTY Where do you get your weed from? OTIS It aint... it aint mine, my erm, my mate left it, he left it here... I could phone him if you want, he\\'ll sort you out... SHIFTY Where d\\'you get your fucking weed from rude boy? A BEAT. OTIS I get it from this geezer... Glen Dowdy innit. Shifty smiles. SHIFTY No, you don\\'t. 74 EXT. VALERIE\\'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / CORRIDOR. DAY Chris stands waiting, he looks uncomfortable. 75 INT. OTIS\\' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY OTIS No his names Glen, I\\'m sure it is man, his names Glen innit? OTIS\\' GIRLFRIEND Yeah, I think so. 37. SHIFTY From now on you get your weed from me... A BEAT. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) At half the price. Otis looks at his girlfriend, and back to Shifty, utterly confused. 76 EXT. VALERIE\\'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY Chris watches a young mum below, she can\\'t be more than 16, pregnant, and with another baby in a pram. He looks saddened by the girl. He turns and walks into the flat. 77 INT. OTIS\\' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY SHIFTY I\\'m gonna sell you your weed half price, and your gonna keep this noise down. A BEAT. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) Yeah? A BEAT. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) (with threat) YEAH? At that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris standing in the doorway. His presence adds menace to the situation. OTIS Yeah, alright, yeah. SHIFTY Because if I hear one word of complaint from next door, just one single complaint, I\\'ll come back here and I\\'ll take your TV, I\\'ll take your stereo, and I\\'ll shove em up your birds arse. He lets the words sink in. The girl looks a little shocked. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) Do you understand me? 38. Otis nods. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? OTIS Yeah, yeah, it\\'s cool, I\\'m sorry, man, I didn\\'t know I had it on loud, I would have turned it down, I\\'m sorry. Silence. Shifty stares Otis out. Otis looks away. Shifty picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on Otis\\' wall. SHIFTY Call me if you need any more weed. He walks into the hallway, past Chris. CHRIS (almost disdain) You don\\'t miss a fucking trick. SHIFTY You know it. 78 INT. VALERIE\\'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / STAIRWELL. DAY Shifty and Chris make their way down the winding stairs of the tenement block, Shifty\\'s phone vibrates. CLOSE ON: THE SCREEN OF THE PHONE READS: TREVOR P MOB. Shifty hits the reject button. Chris follows behind. A BEAT. CHRIS That was all a bit fucking surreal. SHIFTY What d\\'you mean? CHRIS I can\\'t believe you just sold crack to Miss Marple and struck a deal with Blazing Squad. Shifty laughs as they carry on descending. CHRIS (CONT\\'D) How old is she? 39. SHIFTY About 70. A BEAT. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) She\\'s been doing drugs longer than we\\'ve been alive. A BEAT. CHRIS Yeah, d\\'you reckon. A BEAT. CHRIS (CONT\\'D) When did you start knocking out? SHIFTY Knocking out what? CHRIS (lowers his voice) Crack.

SHIFTY No. A BEAT. SHIFTY (CONT\\'D) Have you? CHRIS Fuck that. They still descend the stairs. 40. SHIFTY Do you wanna try it? Chris looks at him, unsure if he\\'s joking. CHRIS Only if I get a fucking discount. SHIFTY (Asian accent) I have to charge you wholesale, you know. I got family in Pakistan, they need ticket for plane travel, man. They both laugh. 79 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY Jasmine is at the kitchen table with Freddie and Katie who are doing potato painting. Jasmine is dialing her mobile. She presses it to her ear. 80 INT. TREVOR\\'S VAN. DAY Trevor is parked up in his van, just staring out. We see his phone vibrating on the dash board. He answers. TREVOR Jasmine... 81 INT. TREVOR\\'S HOUSE / TREVOR\\'S VAN. KITCHEN. DAY Her tone is cold distant. JASMINE Where\\'s the credit card? TREVOR What for? JASMINE I want to book a hire car. TREVOR We don\\'t need one. JASMINE How are we gonna get about with two kids.

JASMINE Don\\'t ruin this holiday for me. Trevor goes quiet. JASMINE (CONT\\'D) Are you still there? TREVOR Yeah. JASMINE Where are you? TREVOR Where do you think. I\\'m on site. JASMINE It doesn\\'t sound like it... A BEAT. TREVOR Babe, look I\\'ve got to go, JASMINE Well what should I do about the car?

       "       'FADE IN 1 BLACK 1 The screen is black. Thunder rumbles. THEO (VO) When you hear thunder... A black bowling ball pulls away from the lens. The ball is in the hands of THEO SKINNER, an intense, handsome 28 year old man with sideburns dressed in worn bowling attire. THEO (VO) ...God is bowling. He holds the ball in front of him, wristbrace on, his face a study in concentration. CUT TO: CREDITS CUT TO: 2 EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 2 An empty causeway spans a bay somewhere along the south shore of Long Island. The sky is overcast. SHEILA, a woman in her late twenties, wearing a full length heliotrope pleather coat over a waitress outfit, kneels in the middle of the road. A souped-up Vespa motor scooter stands nearby. KEN AND BARBIE Sheila holds a Bridal Barbie and Ken doll set. She sets them down on the road, pulls out a can of lighter fluid and soaks the dolls. She pulls out a bowling pin-shaped lighter and torches the nuptial tableau. 3 INT. THEO\\'S CAR 3 Theo drives his ratty old American car along a highway. The car has Ohio plates. He sucks coffee from a 7-Eleven \"Big- Swig\" cup and examines a map. A yellow plastic \"Bowler on Board\" sign is stuck to a side window. Theo\\'s music PLAYS. His eyes nod off, then snap awake. 4 NIGHTMARE 4 The screen is black, except for three circles in the middle of the screen. The light shining through them is snuffed out by three large pink objects. There is a loud POP, like a thumb being pulled out of a tight hole. BOWLING BALL A slow motion low tracking shot of a bowling ball hitting a polished lane. BOWLING PINS Close-up of the milky white surface of two bowling pins on opposite sides of the lane - a seven-ten split. The RUMBLING ball is heard in the distance like a furious hulking steamroller of doom. The pins begin to tremble, and then transform into a Bridal Ken and Barbie. The dolls burst into flame. BALL The ball blasts past the camera and metamorphoses into Theo\\'s car. RAPID DISSOLVE TO: 5 EXT. BRIDGE 5 Theo\\'s sedan blasts past the camera down the empty road. BURNING DOLLS The flaming couple stand in the middle of the bridge. Theo\\'s car hits the pair and they fly into the air in slow-motion. A distant SOUND of pins scattering is heard. The two dolls smoke as they spin into the sky, then hit the water with dual HISSES. DISSOLVE TO: 6 PIN RESET MACHINERY 6 An American Machine and Foundry pin reset machine performs its functions like a mechanical ballet as the camera follows a bowling ball through its journey. The \"Spare Me!\" theme MUSIC (similar to \"Balboa Blue\" by the Marketts) swells. TITLE: SPARE ME! appears on the bowling ball. Pins tumble across the back plate, are loaded into the pin conveyor, lifted up to the crown feeder, distributed into the rotating carousel, and then set down in perfect formation upon the polished bowling alley. BURN-IN PRINCIPAL PLAYER TITLES. Titles appear on the pins. The ball trundles along the return trough straight into the lens. BLACK 7 INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY 7 A muzak cover of \\'Broke, Busted, and Disgusted\\' PLAYS in the background as Theo gingerly pulls a hot taco out of the microwave oven. ALFIE, the rickety old man who runs the store, shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down. Theo pokes at the taco with a spork as steam rises. He pulls a disgusted grimace. Alfie pours himself a cup of coffee and then attempts to open a tiny container of half & half. Because his hands are shaking so much, the cream goes everywhere but into the coffee. ALFIE I\\'m an addict. I can\\'t go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand. ALFIE You\\'re not from around here, are you? THEO I\\'m from Akron. Alfie looks at Theo\\'s bowling shoe attired feet. ALFIE You a bowler? Theo\\'s hand starts shaking uncontrollably. He puts down the cream. THEO I\\'m looking for a man. ALFIE What kind of man? THEO A bowler. Alfie presses a matchbook into Theo\\'s hand and then trundles off. Theo looks down at the matchbook; it reads \"Bowl for health, enjoy yourself. Babylon Lanes.\" 8 EXT. BABYLON LANES - TWILIGHT 8 Theo pulls into the empty parking lot of Babylon Lanes beside a cheap looking American sedan. 9 INT. BABYLON LANES 9 Theo walks into an empty run-down forty lane bowling alley carrying his ball bag. It is dark. The fluorescent lights switch on and the pin re-set machines whirr into action. SID and BREEZE, two shady looking guys in a basement-sale suits walk up lane dividers towards Theo. SID Lane\\'s closed big fellah, league night. THEO I\\'m not here to bowl. SID (gesturing to Theo\\'s bag) You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it? THEO (bristling at the challenge) I\\'m looking for somebody. BREEZE Hey, ain\\'t I seen you on the tour? SID No, pinhead, he ain\\'t here to bowl. THEO I\\'m looking for Buzz Fazeli. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other. BREEZE Fazeli...I don\\'t know no Buzz Fazeli. SID What do you want with old man Faz? THEO Some unfinished business. SID If you wanna do business in this town, there\\'s other people around here got more weight than old Faz. A lady dwarf walks by. DWARF Evening Sid, evening Breeze. SID Evening Tina. BREEZE Good luck tonight Tina. Tina opens a door and goes down some stairs. THEO You guys got something going on downstairs? SID We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community. THEO Basement bingo? Breeze sniggers into his hand SID (smirks) Yeah, basement bingo. BREEZE Lemme see your ball. Breeze grabs Theo\\'s bag. THEO Let go of my bag. Sid sidles around behind Theo who tries to keep him in sight. BREEZE Ah, come on, lemme see your ball. SID You afraid we\\'re gonna steal it? Breeze unzips the bag and pulls the ball out. Theo\\'s temper is rising, he breathes deeply. He is obviously making a Herculean effort to keep himself in check. THEO I said, let go of my bag. With lightning speed Theo\\'s hand shoots out and grabs the middle fingers on Sid\\'s right hand. Sid howls in agony. SID Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers! THEO Tell your little pal to let go. SID Breeze, give him his ball back! Breeze, astonished, drops Theo\\'s ball into the bag. Sid cringes in front of Theo. THEO Where can I find Buzz Fazeli? BREEZE Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid\\'s hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand. BREEZE Haven\\'t seen a ball like that since \\'69. THEO It belonged to my dad. Theo turns and walks out. 10 EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 10 JUNIOR, a dumpy man in his late thirties with a rat tail, bad skin and wearing a white straitjacket and fluorescent orange pants, runs desperately through dark woods. Bloodhounds BARK in the distance. 11 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 11 Theo drives over the draw-bridge and past the Peter Pan Diner with its huge neon sign. 12 EXT. DEAD END STREET 12 Theo\\'s car pulls up in front of a modest suburban house. A rooftop weather vane in the shape of a bowler CREAKS ominously in the wind. 13 EXT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE 13 Theo rings the doorbell. The porch light comes on, and MILLIE, a fifty-five year-old woman dressed for a night on the town in Reno, but with fuzzy slippers and a hairnet, opens the door. A miniscule neurotic poodle leaps at Theo\\'s bowling ball bag, YAPPING and snapping at it. THEO Is Mr. Fazeli in please? MILLIE Who wants to know? (to dog) Zeus! THEO I\\'m a bowler. MILLIE I\\'m sick of you people. Why don\\'t you leave him be? BUZZ (OS) Let him in, Millie. And don\\'t frisk him. 14 INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 14 Millie and Theo, with Zeus hot on his trail, enter the room. BUZZ FAZELI, a sixty-five year-old man shaped a lot like a compressed bowling pin, slouches in a recliner. The room is decorated with trophies of Buzz\\'s bygone pro-bowling halcyon days. MILLIE Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin! BUZZ Clam it! Millie is silent. Buzz gets up and approaches Zeus. BUZZ Hey, rat. C\\'mere. Zeus growls at Buzz as he comes nearer, then clamps onto his sleeve and hangs from his arm, growling ferociously. In one smooth motion, Buzz flings the rabid poodle through an open window and into the night. MILLIE Jerk. She heads outside. BUZZ Sit down. Theo sits on the edge of the couch. Buzz puts out his hand. Theo shakes it. BUZZ Buzz Fazeli. THEO Theo. BUZZ I know your face, you\\'re an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour. THEO I\\'m not on the tour this year. BUZZ (nods understandingly) Need some advice, huh. THEO Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I\\'m a thorn in their side. BUZZ (dismissive wave) Don\\'t worry about the Congress, they\\'re just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies. 15 EXT. THEO\\'S CAR 15 Millie\\'s furry slippers protrude from the driver\\'s side door. Zeus chews furiously on the yellow plastic \\'Bowler On Board\\' sign. She rifles through the contents of the overstuffed glove compartment. She notices her dog. MILLIE (under her breath) Get that outta your mouth! 16 INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 16 THEO They suspended me. BUZZ Why\\'d they suspend you? Theo\\'s eyes glaze over, the lights in the room dim, and Buzz seems to recede into the far distance. 17 TV SCREEN - FLASHBACK 17 In ultra-slow scan we see an image of two bowlers, one is smiling cockily to off-screen fans and waving, the other is Theo, his face filled with hate, winding up to smash the other man in the head with his bowling ball. THEO (VO) It wasn\\'t really my fault. In the far background the hollow booming VOICE of a judge delivers sentence. JUDGE (VO) The American Bowling Congress hereby suspends Theo Maynard Skinner from all professional bowling activities within the jurisdiction of the American Bowling Congress and its international co- signers... The ball mashes into the smirking mans head, causing it to snap forward. The judge\\'s gavel BANGS and the crowd ROARS. 18 INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 18 Theo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Buzz leans in. BUZZ I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day. THEO They suspended me for 100 years. BUZZ 100 years! (knits his brow) THEO I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli. BUZZ (uneasy) What do you think I can do? THEO (sweating slightly) I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you\\'re the king. BUZZ Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I\\'m nothing. It wouldn\\'t do any good for me to talk to the Congress. (briskly changing subject) Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips? THEO I\\'ve never had orange whips, I\\'m from Akron. CUT TO: 19 INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE, KITCHEN 19 Millie and Buzz are in the kitchen, talking in loud whispers. Millie fills a blender while Buzz cuts oranges. MILLIE He\\'s the guy Buzz. BUZZ He\\'s not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips. MILLIE I looked in his car. He\\'s got pictures of you, clippings, maps. BUZZ Bowlers don\\'t go around killing other bowlers. He\\'s only a fan, Millie. I\\'ll give him some tips and an autograph and he\\'s outta here. MILLIE You\\'re in trouble, aren\\'t you Buzz? You\\'re doing something dangerous in that alley. BUZZ Millie, I know what I\\'m doing. MILLIE We should leave this town. I can\\'t take this anymore. I\\'m not gonna let him kill you in my house. 20 INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 20 Buzz rejoins Theo in the living room. THEO Remember the finals in Akron in \\'59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame. BUZZ Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark. THEO Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame. BUZZ That game was before you was born. THEO My mom was there. She told me about it. The \\'Fazeli Split.\\' 21 INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE, KITCHEN 21 The blender is wailing at high speed as Millie throws in a whole box of laxative, a can of Drano and a jar of pills. Her hands are trembling. 22 INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 22 Millie walks into the living room with a silver tray holding two orange whips; one thick and deadly, the other thin and safe. There is laughter coming from both men. BUZZ And the irony is, thirty years later, that prick is bowling in the seniors on TV all over the world, and look at me. Ah well. The docs made me stop, on account of my ticker. (taps his chest) I don\\'t really miss it, but then... (chokes up) ...I miss it. He spies Millie approaching with the tray. BUZZ Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip. Theo takes the other glass. THEO Thanks. ZEUS Zeus is on the sofa, GROWLING and tugging at Theo\\'s bowling bag. The bag rips apart and the ball hits the floor. ORANGE WHIP Theo brings the drink to his lips. The ball rolls across the room. BUZZ The ball rolls into Buzz\\'s feet. BUZZ This your lucky bullet? Buzz picks it up and reads the writing on the ball. He snaps a look into the kitchen, seeing the empty Drano and laxative cartons. Buzz slams the drink away from Theo\\'s lips. The drink explodes across the room. Buzz is up on his feet. BUZZ (with intensity) Where\\'d you get this ball? THEO (stunned - looks at the mess on the floor, then at Buzz) It\\'s mine. BUZZ Who gave it to you? THEO Grace Skinner. BUZZ (astonished) Grace Skinner. Who\\'s Grace Skinner to you? THEO She\\'s my mom. Theo stands and takes the ball from Buzz\\'s hands. Buzz is in shock, staring at Theo. BUZZ (regaining his voice) Who are you? Who sent you here? THEO I\\'m your son. You\\'re a hard father to find. MILLIE Son? BUZZ (to Millie) Millie, please. (to Theo) I don\\'t have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door. THEO (calmly) Grace Skinner Fazeli, you must remember her? Buzz takes Theo by the elbow to eject him from the house. BUZZ I don\\'t know no Grace Skinner. THEO (pulls his arm away) You knew her. You married her in 1963. MILLIE Married? Buzz grabs a large bowling trophy and waves it at Theo. BUZZ You\\'re a bullshit artist, that\\'s what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz. THEO I got a right. You\\'re my father. BUZZ I ain\\'t nobody\\'s father! Theo hurls the trophy at Buzz. He ducks and the trophy sails into a large glass trophy case. Broken glass and trophies fly everywhere. MILLIE (noticing Zeus) ZEUS! Zeus is laid out cold near the spilled orange whip on the living room floor. Millie hunches over her comatose poodle. MILLIE My poor baby! BUZZ (to Theo) You see what you did? (he picks up the ball) Take your ball and get out. Theo takes the ball and exits the house. 23 EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 23 Theo, bathed in sweat, practices his release form with obsessive determination. He is alone near the empty bridge. Sheila spies on him from behind the bridge control booth. Theo takes a long slug from a bottle of liquor. He hears a motor scooter start and ROAR off into the night. 24 INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY 24 Theo stands at the self-serve island sipping coffee. A muzak cover of \\'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\\' PLAYS. THEO (resignedly) 99 years, 241 days, (looks at his watch) 15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down. ALFIE Find your bowler? THEO Yeah, but it didn\\'t go so good. He wasn\\'t the man I thought he\\'d be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee. ALFIE My father used to say to me \"Never...\" no, hmmm. \"Always...\" No, no... (puzzles) Ah! Love and hate are blood relations. THEO Maybe I should have left the ball in the car. 25 EXT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE - DAY 25 Millie kneels on the front lawn patting dirt down on a little grave marked by a wooden cross. Theo walks up. MILLIE He\\'s not here. THEO I\\'m sorry about Zeus, Millie. MILLIE (points to grave) This is a sign! Someone\\'s coming to take Buzz away from me. I don\\'t know if you\\'re the guy or what, but I\\'m not letting it happen. I\\'m leaving him first. THEO I couldn\\'t kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car. MILLIE Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself. THEO He\\'s my father, Millie. MILLIE He\\'s no father to you. Theo lifts a box full of new bowling pins into the trunk. MILLIE Careful with that one. He won\\'t tell me anything, but I know there\\'s something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I\\'d say the old fart wants to die. THEO Where can I find him? MILLIE (looks at her watch) The Peter Pan. Millie gets into the car. MILLIE You tell Buzz I went to my sister\\'s in Ronkonkoma. Oh, I\\'m sorry about trying to kill you last night, Theo. It was nothing personal. Millie puts on a pair of sunglasses and patches out in a cloud of gravel and dust. 26 INT. PETER PAN DINER - DAY 26 A blender WHIRRS. Sheila, in her waitress uniform, carefully chops something. She watches an indoor motocross rally on the diner\\'s color TV. 12-PACK, a hefty construction worker, sits at the counter. 12-PACK Hey Sheila, how\\'s that orange whip comin\\'? SHEILA (mimicking him under her breath) How\\'s that orange whip comin\\'? THWAP! Sheila is dismembering a Ken doll with a big knife. She scoops the parts into the blender and switches from purŽe to frappŽ. 12-PACK So, I heard Junior busted out again? Sheila puts the glass down in front of 12-Pack with a THUNK. 12-PACK Hey Sheila, you can whip my oranges anytime. Sheila puts a Barbie head earring on her left ear. Buzz comes into the diner and slides into a booth. Sheila walks over with a pot of coffee. SHEILA Cup of joe Mr. Fazeli? BUZZ Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn\\'t sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling. SHEILA You don\\'t need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila\\'s gaze. BUZZ (groans) Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz. THEO Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma. BUZZ You know what a mixer ball is? It\\'s like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit. THEO What are you doing over at the lanes that\\'s so dangerous, Buzz? BUZZ You shouldn\\'t listen to her, she\\'s a nervous old Nellie. THEO She thinks someone\\'s trying to kill you. BUZZ I couldn\\'t pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders. BUZZ I\\'ll have my usual please, Sheila. SHEILA Buzz Burger, side of \\'cues. You haven\\'t introduced me to your fan. BUZZ Sheila, meet...uh... (leans in to Theo, sardonically) I forget the name. THEO (uncomfortably) Theo. BUZZ Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner\\'s daughter. SHEILA (eyeing Theo up and down) You look like you\\'re something on the lanes. BUZZ Theo\\'s bowled on the tour. SHEILA Oh, a professional man. What\\'ll you have? THEO What\\'s your specialty? SHEILA Whips...orange whips. THEO Then I\\'ll have the number four with one of your finest whips. SHEILA How do you want it? (their eyes meet) The eggs. THEO (discomfited at the blatant double entendre) Uh...over easy. SHEILA Coming right up. Sheila smiles and walks away. Theo watches her slink behind the counter. BUZZ Watch out for that one. She\\'s got a great average, but she\\'s looking for a prince. And, believe me, she\\'s (more) BUZZ kissed a lotta tadpoles. (looking Theo in the eye) Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I\\'m not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you. (leans in, secretively) Putt-putt golf. THEO Putt-putt golf? Buzz pulls a golf ball from his pocket, flashes it and slips it back. BUZZ It\\'s the next level, the next dimension... (deep conviction) ...the small ball. THEO (in Buzz\\'s spell) The small ball. BUZZ It\\'s gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don\\'t have room for real golf courses in Japan. THEO (snapping out of it) Not for me. Miniature golf\\'s for pansies. BUZZ If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner. THEO (pondering the thought) Maybe I could bowl in Japan. Buzz stands up abruptly. BUZZ I gotta wash up. Buzz heads for the rest rooms. The door opens with a JINGLE. SID Three whips. To go. BREEZE When you get a chance. Sid and Breeze walk over to Theo\\'s booth and slide in. Sid\\'s middle fingers are taped to an aluminum splint. The BLENDER kicks into action. Buzz watches the group from the bathroom hall and tries to catch the conversation. BREEZE Hey, you still here? SID We\\'re looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him? THEO I don\\'t know no Buzz Fazeli. BREEZE Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz\\'s favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from Sid. BUZZ Get away from that burger. BREEZE Sorry Faz, we didn\\'t know you was here. SID Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you. BREEZE (to Theo and Buzz) Are you guys bruddas? The booth party is silent for a moment. Theo LAUGHS. BUZZ No, we ain\\'t brothers. SID You know why we call him Breeze? Sid puts a hand near Breezes left ear and blows into Breeze\\'s right ear. He makes fluttering motions with his hand as if wind was hitting it. Breeze\\'s face breaks into a smile as he pushes Sid away. BREEZE Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I\\'m serious! You guys are related, right? THEO He\\'s my dad. Buzz flashes a warning glare to Theo. Sid grabs some of Buzz\\'s french fries. BUZZ (slapping his hand) Get your own. BREEZE See that, toldja Sid. I knew I seen a resemblance. BUZZ Why don\\'t you clowns get your whips and get lost. SID Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you... (gazing artfully upwards and rubbing his chin) What was that he said...? BREEZE I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don\\'t like no sticky fingers in the till. SID (exasperated) Pinhead! Don\\'t just blurt it right out. Sheila comes over and PLUNKS down the three whips-to-go. BREEZE (to Sheila) Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door. SID So Buzz, let\\'s skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs. THEO I\\'m coming with you. Sid shies away from Theo, protecting his hand. BUZZ Easy. I got business to do, Theo. I\\'ll come back and haunt you later. (drops a twenty on the table, pats Theo\\'s cheek) Don\\'t say I never gave you nothing. Buzz goes outside with a sleazeball on either side. Sheila takes the twenty dollar bill. Theo grabs his jacket and makes for the door. THEO (to Sheila) Do those two work for your dad or mine? SHEILA Mine, and they never tip. The sleazeballs hustle Buzz into the front seat of their car and patch out. THEO Do you know where they\\'re taking him? SHEILA Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits. 27 EXT. WOODS - DAY 27 Junior is running at breakneck speed through the thick brush. Bloodhounds BARK. Junior slows down and drops to his knees, gasping for breath. He looks up to the sky. The camera pushes up to his sweaty, tortured face. JUNIOR (shrieks) SHEILA! 28 INT. BABYLON LANES, BUZZ\\'S OFFICE 28 MILES KASTLE lounges in a cheap chair behind Buzz\\'s desk toying with one of those motorized wire balancing sculptures they have in airport souvenir concessions. He is a carefully groomed middle-aged low-budget version of Hugh Hefner in an acrylic sweatsuit with \\'Miles \\'O\\' Lanes\\' embroidered on the front. Sid and Breeze push Buzz into the room. Buzz is poker faced. KASTLE Buzz. Buzz nods. KASTLE (to Breeze) You got my whip? Breeze pulls the third whip out of a bag and gives it to him. KASTLE (motions to Sid and Breeze) Lose yourselves. Sid and Breeze leave the room. Buzz goes to a locker and begins changing into a flashy MC outfit. BUZZ What\\'s on your mind, Miles? KASTLE We\\'ve been partners a long time now, haven\\'t we Buzz? BUZZ Seven years. Kastle pokes a straw into the whip and takes a long drag. KASTLE This scam we got going here was your (more) KASTLE brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch. (pulls a smile) And now we got a beautiful thing. BUZZ It\\'s a beautiful thing. KASTLE A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt. MILES We got balance. Kastle flicks the little wire man. It bobs and sways. KASTLE A partnership is a very delicate balance. But let\\'s say something tips the scales, maybe one partner takes more than his share, then... Kastle tips the wire man off his perch. The little motor squeals pathetically. KASTLE ... oops. We got no more balance. Buzz looks on with narrowed eyes as he adjusts his cravat. KASTLE And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz. KASTLE Simple math, Buzz. (he holds up his fingers) Two plus two does not equal three. BUZZ Miles, I\\'ve always been on the square with you. KASTLE I\\'m sure you have Buzz. BUZZ Wish me luck. Buzz jogs out into a spotlight. KASTLE Break a leg... (sneers) ...partner. 29 INT. DWARF BOWLING ALLEY 29 APPLAUSE erupts as Buzz appears in the spotlight. The dwarf bowling alley is a pungently smoke-filled room peopled with shady, washed-up bowlers sitting in chairs behind a bowling lane. The old-timers are shouting and pounding shots. BUZZ (over the PA) Greetings, ladies, gentlemen. (the place grows silent) My dentist told me this one the other day: How many bowlers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? AUDIENCE How many? BUZZ It takes three bowlers to screw in a lightbulb. One to hold the bulb, one to turn the ladder, and one to hold their balls. Thank you, thank you. Just throw money. CUT TO: 30 EXT. BABYLON LANES - EVENING 30 Theo drives through the full parking lot of Babylon Lanes. He pulls around the back and sees dark figures slip into a back door. He parks his car, walks over to the now closed door. It\\'s locked. Theo finds another entrance and sneaks in. He creeps his way through the darkened alley towards the sound of raucous partying. BUZZ (OS) Welcome to Buzz Fazeli\\'s Dwarf Bowling, folks, where we bring you the finest in specialized bowling entertainment. THEO\\'S POV Through a crack in a door Theo can see Buzz standing in the spotlight. BUZZ I would like to draw your attention to the top of the lane. (a Casio drum roll PLAYS) Weighing in at sixty-nine pounds and standing exactly three feet - the diminutive dominatrix Teeny Weenie Tina the Terrible! The crowd CHEERS as the spotlight moves to Tina, a masked lady dwarf duded up in a combination black leather and cowhide western style S&M outfit. She CRACKS a whip and leers at the bowlers. They HOWL with excitement. BUZZ Don\\'t be shy, folks! Tina straps into her customized skateboard. A drunken customer forks over a wad of bills, steps up and grabs hold of the mini-human projectile. BUZZ And - bowl \\'er! Tina is hurled head-first towards the pins. The crowd goes wild. TINA\\'S POV The camera tracks low behind Tina as she crashes into the pins. 31 INT. BABYLON LANES, BATHROOM 31 Theo sneaks into an empty bathroom. He hears voices and ducks into a stall. Sid and Breeze shove Buzz into the room. SID Seems to me like you ain\\'t got much choice Buzz. Sid shoves Buzz over to Breeze, Breeze shoves him back. BREEZE You\\'re between Miles Kastle and a hard place. BUZZ Aaay, hands off the tux! Sid checks under the stalls, sees Theo\\'s feet and whips open the door. SID The busyboy! Sid yanks Theo out. THEO Get your hands off me, you moron. Theo tries to free himself from Sid\\'s grip. He turns to Buzz. THEO What the fuck is this? BUZZ What\\'s it look like to you? THEO It looks like dwarf bowling. SID Very good, busyboy. THEO (with intensity) Dwarf bowling\\'s illegal. SID (sarcastically) What are you gonna do, call the bowling police? BREEZE Heh, heh, heh. THEO You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical! BUZZ I do what I gotta do to survive. THEO You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face. BUZZ I\\'m more of a bowler than you\\'ll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain\\'t asking anyone to bail me out. THEO I\\'m your blood. BUZZ You wish! Theo pushes Buzz up against a stack of boxes full of new bowling pins. Sid and Breeze hover behind them. THEO You knew she was pregnant. Buzz reaches inside a box and pulls out a pin. He waves it threateningly at Theo. BUZZ What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin. THEO Don\\'t say that about my mom! BUZZ I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles. THEO Fuck you and fuck bowling. BUZZ That\\'s a laugh. You\\'re all strung out. You\\'re a bowling junkie. THEO I don\\'t need the stinking pro-tour. BUZZ You\\'re dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face. DISSOLVE TO: 32 DWARF BOWLING ALLEY 32 Theo is dragged through the dwarf alley crowd. He has blood on his face. Half dazed, he looks up at all the distorted leering faces that peer down at him. The crowd cat-calls and laughs at Theo. 33 EXT. BABYLON LANES, PARKING LOT - EVENING 33 Theo is thrown onto the asphalt. Sid kicks Theo. SID You shoulda taken our advice, busyboy. 34 EXT. PETER PAN DINER - DAY 34 Theo sits in his parked car outside the Peter Pan diner. Squinting in the bright light, he examines the cuts on his face in the sideview mirror. He is looking scruffier. He sees Sheila come out of the diner, start her scooter, and pull out into traffic. He follows her. 35 EXT. BRIDGE 35 He follows the Vespa at a discreet distance as Sheila drives over the bridge. The weather is windy and threatening. Thunder RUMBLES. 36 EXT. MILES \\'O\\' LANES 36 Theo pulls in next to Sheila\\'s scooter under the big neon sign for Miles \\'O\\' Lanes Bowling Center. With a huge CLAP of thunder and the SOUND of falling pins, the skies release a pounding downpour. 37 KEN AND BARBIE, MACRO C.U. 37 Sheila\\'s Vespa is parked in the handicapped space. The dolls are wired to the headset of the scooter. Large droplets of rain roll down their faces. 38 INT. MILES \\'O\\' LANES 38 Theo walks into an ultramodern eighty-lane bowling center, bowling bag in hand. A huge banner reads \\'Mothers and Daughters Bowl Free Tonight!\\' The entire place is filled with pairs of moms and their daughters - bowling away in matching bowling attire. A three year-old girl stands staring at Theo. THEO Hello. LITTLE GIRL Waaaaaaaaah! A mom grabs the little girl and whisks her away. Theo surveys the alley and catches sight of Sheila bowling at the far end of the alley. 39 LANE, SHEILA & LUNA 39 Sheila bowls with LUNA, a 30-ish black guy dressed in a Miles \\'O\\' Lanes jumpsuit and wearing extensions in his hair. Sheila prods her friend when she sees Theo. SHEILA Luna, that\\'s the guy. I saw him do this spooky bowling rain dance on the bridge. LUNA Typical. Theo walks over. Sheila presents Theo with her ball. SHEILA Here Theo, it\\'s the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing. THEO I\\'m not here to - I can\\'t... Sheila can\\'t release the ball from Theo\\'s now-paralytic grip. SHEILA (knowing nod) Bowling block. 40 INT. MILES KASTLE\\'S OFFICE 40 Kastle, Sid, and Breeze stare at a bank of video monitors, their faces illuminated by the screens. BREEZE Think he\\'ll bowl it? KASTLE Nah, he won\\'t do it. SID Weird, comes into alleys and doesn\\'t bowl. KASTLE It\\'s not an \"Alley\". I hate when people call it a \"Bowling Alley\", it\\'s so common! I prefer \"Bowling Center\". BREEZE What\\'s this guy here for, anyway? KASTLE Maybe he\\'s here to pay his last respects. SID Someone gonna get kacked, boss? KASTLE If I find out Buzz is comin\\' up short on dwarf bowling, it\\'s lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other. KASTLE I hired you rent-a-thugs to keep tabs on the Faz. I want you all over him like a tent. Find out how that little weasel\\'s ripping me off. Buzz Fazeli\\'s gonna blow the lid off dwarf bowling! 41 LANE, SHEILA & THEO 41 The two of them sit together behind the lanes. THEO I came here to have a word with your dad. SHEILA What do you want with my dad? THEO Business. SHEILA Won\\'t your father help you with that? THEO (shakes his head) Having a legend for a dad isn\\'t all it\\'s cracked up to be. SHEILA Your dad\\'s one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle\\'s proffered hand. KASTLE So you\\'re Buzz\\'s boy. I\\'ve been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn\\'t come and see me sooner. THEO You know who I am? KASTLE Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don\\'t mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away. KASTLE I heard you\\'ve been having a little trouble with the Congress. (waves at a mother/daughter couple) Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers. THEO You might say I\\'m at the top of their shit list. KASTLE Maybe I can help you. (calling to a young bowler) Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you\\'ll get hurt with that big ball, honey. (to Theo) I\\'ve seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day. THEO What\\'s with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle? KASTLE (dismissive gesture) It\\'s nothing, just a slight business imbalance. (to a seated mother) How\\'s Gloria\\'s thumb? MOTHER (OC) The blister\\'s worse than last week. KASTLE No pain, no gain! Keep trying the ice. Chin up, sweetie. (turning to Theo) This place is a bowling oasis. THEO It\\'s very...clean. They pause and Kastle waves to some bowlers. MRS. JACKSON (OC) Hello, Mr.Kastle. KASTLE Hello, Violet. How\\'s my favorite \\'bowlerina\\' doing? MRS. JACKSON (OC) 132, 154. KASTLE You keep that up Carmelita and one day you\\'ll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita\\'s got the stuff? THEO That\\'s some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball\\'s flat, she needs to work on her spin control. KASTLE That\\'s right, didn\\'t you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ? (to Carmelita) Now go take out your \"big four\", darling. (to Theo) Come on, we\\'re making her nervous. They continue walking. KASTLE I get them while they\\'re young. Builds loyalty. MRS. JACKSON (OC) She hit it, Mr. Kastle! KASTLE (waving over his shoulder) Four or five years when a girl like that\\'s bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she\\'ll pay a handsome profit on my investment. THEO And the dwarf bowling? They stop, and Kastle pulls Theo over to an enormous aquarium near the lounge. KASTLE (making sweeping gesture) Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. (more) KASTLE Profits down there, philanthropy up here. (looks at Theo) Besides, it beats the pants off bingo. THEO Nice set-up. KASTLE If it springs a leak, it\\'ll be because Buzz is making waves. THEO What if he wants to get out? KASTLE (chuckles) He\\'s earned an early retirement. (sprays his mouth with Binaca) But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future. (puts his arm around Theo) I wanna show you something. 42 INT. MILES KASTLE\\'S OFFICE 42 Kastle and Theo stand in front of the huge bank of video screens. KASTLE Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy. THEO What ever happened to just bowling? KASTLE There\\'s a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive. THEO I like the sport the way it is. KASTLE A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! - shish kebabs. (puts his arm around Theo) Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good. (pauses for effect) I think I could help you, Theo. THEO (he\\'s been waiting for this) How Mr. Kastle? KASTLE You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you. THEO Why would you help me? KASTLE I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul. Kastle turns to his video screens. KASTLE But, now that you mention it, you could afford me one minor dispensation. Theo follows his gaze to the screen. KASTLE While you\\'re in town, I need you to keep an eye on my daughter for a couple of days. Her big brother broke out of the mental hospital... Theo\\'s eyes glaze over, the lights in the office dim, and Kastle seems to recede into the far distance. 43 THEO\\'S POV - NIGHTMARE 43 As running FOOTSTEPS are heard, the camera whizzes down a darkened alley towards the pins. KASTLE (OS) ...and I want someone watching out for Sheila while he\\'s, uh, loose. 44 EXT. WOODS - NIGHTMARE 44 The heels of Junior\\'s running feet. KASTLE (OS) Junior\\'s a problem child. He has a thing about - JUNIOR (wails) SHEILA! 45 INT. MILES KASTLE\\'S OFFICE 45 Theo snaps out of it, the room lights come up, and Kastle points to her image on the TV screen. Sheila turns and looks up at the video camera. Theo and Sheila\\'s eyes seem to meet. Theo freezes for a moment. THEO I could do that. As the two men shake hands, Sheila \"flips the bird\" to the camera. KASTLE One thing, (pointing to Theo\\'s mid- section) keep the meat in the freezer. CUT TO: 46 EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY EVENING 46 Theo and Sheila blast along the dark roadway on her Vespa, Theo sitting behind Sheila. THEO (shouting above the engine) This is a vicious cycle. SHEILA I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do. THEO Isn\\'t this technically a scooter? SHEILA When I\\'m on my bike I feel like a wild person. (she looks sideways at Theo) Better than any sex I\\'ve ever had. THEO Kinda tough on the butt. SHEILA Everything has it\\'s drawbacks. THEO Where did your brother escape from? SHEILA The mental hospital. THEO What does he do? SHEILA He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while... THEO Whoa. SHEILA It\\'s a vicious cycle. CUT TO: 47 EXT. PARKING FIELD 47 Sheila and Theo motor across an empty beach parking field towards a lone station wagon. Swing-a-delic MUSIC drifts from the parked vehicle. 47 EXT. STATION WAGON 47 Sheila pulls up beside the wagon. She leads Theo towards a group of partying people at the tailgate of the car; three white women, three white men and Luna. Luna pulls a rubber hookah hose out of his mouth and offers it to Theo. LUNA Hookah? THEO No thanks, I don\\'t hookah. LUNA Theo, you ever do the \\'Swing\\'? Theo shakes his head. SHEILA These guys all work at the alley, too. This is John, Susan, Jon, Suzanne, Jonathan, and Sue. Everyone welcomes Theo and Sheila. LUNA (screams) Dance Break! Luna throws himself into a wild body-whip as the music THROBS massively. EXT. DANCE Luna and Sheila do a wild jitterbug-derived Swing-a-Delic dance surrounded by weaving white folk. EXT. BARBECUE One of the guys is on crutches, has a neck brace, a chest cast, and one arm in a truss. He stands by the barbecue and flips burgers with his one free hand. Theo walks over to him. GUY Hey man, howyadoin\\'? He wiggles his hand out of the end of his cast. Theo shakes his fingers. THEO Don\\'t tell me, John. JOHN Cool! THEO Theo. Howzitgoin. JOHN Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother\\'s not around. Somebody blew out Junior\\'s pilot light, if you get my meaning. THEO How\\'s that? JOHN I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn\\'t a been there, he wouldn\\'t have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin\\' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger? THEO (meets eyes with Sheila) Uh...over easy. JOHN (throws a blackened burger on Theo\\'s styrofoam plate) I\\'ll tell you one thing, you won\\'t see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don\\'t play any of his fuckin\\' knock-knock jokes. Luna comes over to Theo and grabs him. They start to dance. LUNA Sheila wants me to show you a few steps before you two swing-a-delic. THEO (uneasily) So, you\\'re the pinman around here? LUNA ...And one, and two, and yes, I am. But no one gets them working like Junior used to...and two, and one.. - they call him The \\'Quasimodo of the lanes.\\' He\\'s the best pinman there is.. and one and two...People used to say he got the machines working so well \\'cause he lubricated them with blood...and two, and one...but people just love saying things about Junior. SHEILA Mind if I cut in? THEO No, not at all. EXT. DANCE Theo pulls out his resin bag, powders up his hands, and goes for Sheila. Theo and Sheila get low and nasty on the tarmac. Sheila turns and does the freak to Theo, rubbing her rear end into his crotch. As Theo and Sheila dance over near John he makes a throat slitting gesture across his neck. Theo\\'s hands leave white prints on Sheila\\'s butt. The Swing-a-delic funks so hard it causes spontaneous audience dance riots and structural damage in theaters across the country. SHEILA You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo. THEO The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers. SHEILA Can I ask you something personal? THEO I\\'d rather you didn\\'t. SHEILA Do you have a girlfriend? THEO Not while I\\'m in training. SHEILA Do you have a boyfriend? THEO (surprised) No. Do You? SHEILA No. Not at the present. EXT. PARKING FIELD - NIGHT Sheila and Theo toast marshmallows over the barbecue as the rest of the party dances in the background. THEO So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates? SHEILA Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he\\'s the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants. THEO Unfortunately what he wants is you. SHEILA So, what about you? THEO Do I want you? SHEILA We\\'ll get into that later. CUT TO: 48 INT. MILES KASTLE\\'S OFFICE 48 Alone, Kastle stares at the bank of video monitors and runs a battery powered fuzzball remover around his collar. The monitors are deserted. Miles absently pans a camera over and then sits bolt upright. On the screen he can see Buzz Fazeli, in a room at Babylon Lanes, surrounded by large piles of cash, stuffing rolls of bills into hollow bowling pins. KASTLE (with rising anger) Why that filthy, slimey, double-crossing, misbegotten, two-faced, mangy, son-of-a- bitch bastard! The motor in the fuzz ball remover SHRIEKS as Miles squeezes it to death. It shatters in his hands. 49 EXT. PARKING FIELD - NIGHT 49 Theo and Sheila lie on the roof of the station wagon. \"Devil With The Blue Dress\" by Shorty Long plays on the stereo. The rest of the party throws marshmallows at each other in the distance. SHEILA Theo, what would you do if you couldn\\'t bowl? THEO I don\\'t know. It\\'s all I ever wanted to do. SHEILA I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn\\'t really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I\\'m not insulting you. THEO No, I\\'m fascinated. SHEILA Why were you suspended? THEO I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling. SHEILA So you\\'re hoping Buzz can get you re- instated? THEO Well, that was plan A. SHEILA What\\'s plan B? THEO Plan B is your dad. SHEILA What do you think my dad\\'s gonna do for you? THEO He said he\\'d sponsor me. SHEILA Ha! And what do you have to do for him? THEO Nothing. SHEILA Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn\\'t do anything unless there\\'s something in it for him. THEO He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days. SHEILA What? Be my body guard? (she laughs) Here\\'s my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad\\'s sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt. THEO Sheila, please. SHEILA Come on Theo, what about plan C? THEO (looking worried) What\\'s plan C? SHEILA Plan C... (opens her shirt, showing off her brassiere) ...is me. Sheila takes Theo\\'s nervous hands and places them inside her shirt. THEO (torn) Look, Sheila, I really like you but... Sheila rolls on top of him, and plants a hickey on his neck. THEO (stopping her) Forget it, Sheila. 50 INT. MILES \\'O\\' LANES 50 Kastle hurries through the darkened bowling alley. He stops short as a warning alarm begins to sound from somewhere deep within the building. Lane six lights up and comes to life. Kastle walks slowly forward. KASTLE Junior? Is that you, Junior? Don\\'t be afraid. Where are you? I won\\'t hurt you. INT. MACHINERY GALLEY Kastle stealthily sneaks along beside row upon row of silent pin reset machines shining a flashlight in front of him. KASTLE Come on, Junior. Everyone\\'s waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior\\'s face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy. JUNIOR Needs lubrication. Lubrication. KASTLE We\\'re having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light. JUNIOR You made me hurt him! Kastle reaches into his pocket and pulls a gaudy digital wristwatch from his pocket. KASTLE Look what I got for you. He holds the watch up in front of Junior. Junior looks curiously at the watch. KASTLE Happy Birthday Junior! The watch begins to play an electronic version of \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.\" Junior\\'s face lights up. JUNIOR Ooooooohhh. Kastle begins luring Junior out of machine number six with the watch. KASTLE I have someone for you to play with Junior. JUNIOR Someone wants to play with me? KASTLE I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior. JUNIOR Blueface! Blueface is my favorite. 51 EXT. ROAD, SID & BREEZE\\'S CAR - DAY 51 Breeze and Sid speed down a road in their damaged hulk. The TENOR of Enrico Caruso can be heard from inside. 51 INT. SID & BREEZE\\'S CAR 51 Breeze drives. Sid gazes out the window. Enrico Caruso WAILS from the car stereo. SID Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct. BREEZE La da da dalala... SID (looking heatedly disturbed) I hate fuckin\\' opera. BREEZE How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music! SID How do you know, you don\\'t even speak Latin? BREEZE You listen to the feelings, not the words. SID You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just \\'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin\\' opera. BREEZE It was a clearance. Sid seems to calm down. SID (wistfully) You know, Elvis bowled. BREEZE No kiddin\\'. SID Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no (more) SID gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun. BREEZE (sympathetically) Sure, Sid. SID (becoming rabid) But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain\\'t what it used to be. There\\'s something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden - BREEZE (getting excited) - canker sore. SID (apoplectic) Right, eating at the core, eating it\\'s way out. It makes me sick! Sid starts pressing buttons on the tape deck SID How do you turn this thing off? BREEZE Wait! That\\'s an aria! Sid and Breeze struggle for the cassette. The music DISTORTS into a warbling gurgle of an aria. SID Gimme that! Sid yanks the cassette out, but the tape becomes tangled in the player. He pulls at the endless yards of tape and throws the whole mess out the window. 52 EXT. PETER PAN DINER - DAY 52 Theo, wearing sunglasses and dressed in a jogging suit similar to Miles Kastle\\'s, steps out of the diner with a bag containing four orange whips. He goes over to his parked car. Buzz walks up. BUZZ (in deadly serious) Theo, I want you to get out of this town. THEO I\\'m getting to like it here. BUZZ Did that porcupine say he\\'d get you back on the tour? THEO I gotta survive. BUZZ (shaking his head) He\\'ll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life. THEO You got a better offer? BUZZ No... THEO I didn\\'t think so. Theo takes a long drag from his orange whip. BUZZ Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television. THEO (bitterly) That\\'s right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split. BUZZ You never even took the shot. You couldn\\'t do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner. THEO (repressed fury in his voice) I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz. BUZZ Look, kid, gimme a break. I\\'m an old man. (taps chest) I\\'m runnin\\' on a Delrin aorta. I\\'m finished - dead from my ankles up. THEO I couldn\\'t care less. Theo starts his car. BUZZ You know what I think? You didn\\'t come here to find a father. You didn\\'t even come here for help. You just came here to take it all out on somebody. Well it ain\\'t gonna be me! Theo pulls out of the parking lot. Buzz yells after him. BUZZ (at the top of his lungs) I SHOULDA HAD MY TUBES TIED! 53 EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, GARAGE 53 The Kastle home is a huge nouveau riche Brady Bunch style house with a large deck jutting over the driveway. The doors are open on the spacious two car garage. Sheila has the headset of her Vespa disassembled. Theo walks up the driveway, orange whips in hand. SHEILA I don\\'t think your new outfit suits you, Theo. THEO (flicking dust off the suit) Really? I kinda like it. He sits nearby. SHEILA Do you talk with your mom? THEO It\\'s been awhile. She didn\\'t want me looking for my dad. SHEILA My mom told me not to stay in this town. THEO So why do you stay? SHEILA I\\'m a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I\\'m trapped in his easy payment plan. THEO I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers. SHEILA Yeah, but they\\'re all little wannabes. I\\'m looking for a professional man. THEO (he ponders the thought) I may not be a pro bowler, but I\\'m no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo. SHEILA (touches his lips) How much would you charge me for the lips? THEO More than you could afford. SHEILA Come on, bargain with me. THEO I could let them go for ten. SHEILA (she pulls away, slightly) You professional men drive a hard bargain. I\\'m afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill. THEO (smiles) If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him. 54 EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DECK 54 Sheila and Theo stand on the deck. Sheila scans the road leading to the house with binoculars. THEO What are you going to do about your brother? SHEILA You\\'re here. THEO What about the guy he put in the body cast? BINOCULAR POV The road is empty SHEILA Momentary relapse. Except for that, he\\'s been making progress. Sheila laughs. Theo nervously pulls his collar up over the hickey on his neck. SHEILA Junior is like a faithful doggy. He loves his birthday so much, that every year, before we can go pick him up... BINOCULAR POV Kastle\\'s car appears, driving hell-for- leather towards the house. SHEILA ...he breaks out of the hospital and comes home on his own. Here they come. She hands the binoculars to Theo, who immediately trains them on the road. SHEILA My mom once had an affair. When my dad found out, he had Junior kill the man. The body was never found, but I think Junior took him to the alley. Theo lowers the binoculars and looks at Sheila. THEO Then it\\'s true, isn\\'t it? About... SHEILA ...lane six. Yes. 55 EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DRIVEWAY 55 Kastle\\'s car comes belly-flopping to a stop in front of the house. Kastle climbs out and gesticulates wildly to the couple. KASTLE (a loud whisper) He\\'s here! Come on down! BLACKNESS INSIDE THE TRUNK KASTLE (OS) (muffled) OK, hats on everybody. SOUNDS of the group gathering outside can be heard. SHEILA (OS) (muffled) Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it. KASTLE (OS) (muffled) Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three! The lid flies up and Kastle, Sheila, and Theo stand there, with party hats and party horns in their mouths. They all cheer and throw confetti. EVERYONE Surprise! Kastle takes a flash snapshot. Junior, lying on some folded blankets in the trunk, looks at his family with a stunned expression. He is in a straitjacket. Junior\\'s new watch begins to PLAY \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\". He struggles to pull his arm out, but can\\'t. Kastle reaches in to untie the straitjacket. KASTLE Steady boy, steady. Untied, Junior presses the BEEPING watch against his ear. His face breaks into a beatific smile. CUT TO: 56 EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, PICNIC TABLE - AFTERNOON 56 Kastle pulls shish kebab chunks off a skewer. He looks down to see that one of the chunks is a melted Ken head. He throws it away in disgust. KASTLE I bet you didn\\'t know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can\\'t bowl anymore either. Isn\\'t that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior\\'s right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank. KASTLE See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior. SHEILA After we eat, Dad. KASTLE He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand. JUNIOR It\\'s not so bad. When I\\'m alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father. SHEILA Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I\\'m interested in? KASTLE (whispers back, defensively) You\\'re just like you mother! Always jealous! SHEILA That\\'s why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything! KASTLE She ran away to be with that... (spits out his words) that Motocross champion. JUNIOR Your turn, Theo. Why can\\'t you bowl? Sheila and Kastle sit up. THEO I don\\'t like to talk about it. JUNIOR You\\'re prone to violent outbursts, aren\\'t you? THEO It depends. JUNIOR It feels good to let it out, doesn\\'t it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father. SHEILA You\\'re using Theo for your own deviant purposes! KASTLE Look who\\'s talking! SHEILA Leave him alone! KASTLE Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn\\'t mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that. (snaps his fingers) Sheila and Kastle sit up. KASTLE Junior, how \\'bout a riddle? JUNIOR (turns to Sheila) Sheila. Knock-knock. Sheila glances nervously at Theo. JUNIOR (impatiently) Come on Sheila, knock-knock. SHEILA Who\\'s there? JUNIOR Junior. SHEILA Junior who? JUNIOR J\\'you-and-your-friend do it yet? (laughs) KASTLE (laughing) Fantastic! What talent. SHEILA (caustically) You still got the touch Junior. CUT TO: 57 EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, CAKE 57 A bowling pin-shaped cake with candles ablaze is presented to a seated Junior. He is wearing a paper birthday hat. The four orange whips are arrayed around the table. KASTLE Make a wish, son. Junior stares into Sheila\\'s eyes for several seconds. JUNIOR Same wish as last year. Sheila blows out the candles in a hurry. SHEILA It won\\'t come true, Junior. Kastle places a gift-wrapped box in front of Junior and lifts the lid. He reaches in and pulls out a huge, intricate claw- like arm-shaped device made of plastic and metal and covered with cables. KASTLE It\\'s a bowling claw. You can bowl now, Junior. With the whole family. Junior beams at the group. KASTLE (puts one arm around Junior and one on Theo) Pretty soon everybody can bowl! The two sleazeballs walk up onto the deck and over to the table. SID Hello Mr. Kastle. (nods to seated party) Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden! BREEZE Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring. JUNIOR Knock, knock. BREEZE Who\\'s... SID (interrupting) Don\\'t do it Breeze! (to Junior) You ain\\'t getting us into that. Kastle gets up. KASTLE Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands. SID (to Theo) If Junior thinks you\\'re doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he\\'s gonna tap dance on your spleen. (pokes Theo in the side) BREEZE (pulls down Theo\\'s collar to reveal the hickey) With cleats. The two men turn, laughing, and follow Kastle. 58 EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DRIVEWAY 58 Kastle huddles with Sid and Breeze, Jr. stands nearby fiddling with his new bowling arm. KASTLE Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other. SID No! KASTLE I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there. JUNIOR (perks up at mention of lane six) I\\'m gonna play Blue Face! CUT TO: 59 EXT. BABYLON LANES, PARKING LOT 59 Buzz checks if the coast is clear and then stuffs boxes of bowling pins into the trunk of his car. CUT TO: 60 EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DECK 60 Theo and Kastle stand on the deck watching the sleazeballs put Junior into the trunk of their car. Kastle lights an oversized cigar and hands one to Theo. MILES Champ, as soon as you get back on the tour, we should do an instructional videotape. \\'RAMBOWL\\' Theo Skinner teaches Power Bowling. You on the cover with a flame thrower. Kastle lights Theo\\'s cigar and they puff away. KASTLE Theo, how would you like to be my new partner? THEO You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs\\' car pulls out of the driveway. KASTLE I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he\\'s retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila. KASTLE Here, Bunny. Why don\\'t you two go and do something fun tonight, on me. Sheila is lured to the scent of the plastic like a junkie to a fix. KASTLE One thing, stay away from the lanes. If Junior sees you two together, he\\'ll swallow his tongue. She reaches for the card and Kastle snatches it away from her with a chortle. KASTLE What did I say? SHEILA Don\\'t go near the bowling alley. KASTLE (enunciating clearly) Bowling \"Center\"! Kastle hands her the card and heads into the house. SHEILA It wouldn\\'t bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it? THEO Nope, I couldn\\'t care less. SHEILA I\\'m sure you wouldn\\'t care if he needed your help, right? THEO Why should I help that old fuck. SHEILA (sarcastically) Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you? THEO Zip. SHEILA And besides, it\\'s probably too late, anyhow. THEO (exhaling cigar smoke) Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history. (goes to take another drag, then stops) Too late for what? She turns away. SHEILA Nothing. THEO Too late for what, Sheila? SHEILA You know how people with broken bones know when there\\'s a storm coming? THEO You got any broken bones? SHEILA No, but something\\'s gonna blow in this town. I can feel it. THEO Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable. SHEILA (faltering) I can\\'t tell you, Theo. THEO Why not? SHEILA I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders. THEO (gently) Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head. SHEILA I\\'m afraid you\\'ll hurt him. THEO It\\'s Junior, isn\\'t it. SHEILA (starting to cry) I can\\'t - I can\\'t do it. (she looks up through her tears at Theo) He\\'s my brother. THEO He\\'s my father. CUT TO: 61 EXT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE - NIGHT 61 Sid and Breeze\\'s car sits in front of Buzz\\'s house. 8-track opera PLAYS on the car stereo. A man screams and glass smashes. INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE P.O.V. shot running desperately through the house, knocking things over, smashing things. We HEAR Buzz screaming in terror. The scream is cut off. With a THUD, the camera falls over and hits the floor. The golf ball rolls slowly into view, and stops. Footsteps recede, a door slams, and a car drives away. CUT TO: 62 EXT. MILES \\'O\\' LANES - NIGHT 62 Theo and Sheila walk her Vespa up to the darkened alley. Theo is wearing his own clothes again. The SOUND of a lone bowler is heard. Theo straps on his wristbrace. Sheila pulls out keys. SHEILA These open the back door. Don\\'t let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you\\'re trapped. I\\'ll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm. SHEILA You don\\'t have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron, or anywhere else. THEO (dislodging her hand gently) I\\'ll be at the bridge. 63 INT. MILES \\'O\\' LANES 63 Theo snakes his way along the rows of pin machines, towards the only light source - lane six. As he leans in to peer through the machine, a ball EXPLODES into the pins. Junior, wearing his elaborate bowling claw, is working himself into a sweaty froth. Junior picks up his ball and sends it CRASHING into the pins. THEO Knock-knock. JUNIOR (stops and looks around) Who\\'s there? Theo remains silent. JUNIOR (getting angry) Who\\'s there! THEO Buzz Fazeli. JUNIOR NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who\\'s there. I say who\\'s there and then you say who who. You\\'re not playing right. (primly) Knock-knock. THEO Who\\'s there? Junior walks towards Theo. JUNIOR Junior. Theo remains silent. JUNIOR JUNIOR! (boiling) You\\'re supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I\\'m going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another. JUNIOR You shouldn\\'t touch her. THEO No, Junior, you shouldn\\'t touch her. JUNIOR Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her. THEO What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles. JUNIOR He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games. THEO (struggling to get away) What did you do to Buzz? JUNIOR You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I\\'m gonna play Blue-Face with you. (he grabs Theo\\'s throat) THEO (hoarsely) I don\\'t want to play. Theo stretches to get a nearby ball, but just can\\'t reach it, by millimeters. JUNIOR To play, I press my fingers on a throat like this... (he presses tighter on Theo\\'s windpipe) ...and then the mans face would go blue and I should keep pressing... (Theo\\'s face goes pale blue) ...and I did and then he stopped moving and he didn\\'t play anymore after that. Theo bends back a finger on Junior\\'s hand. Junior lets out a HOWL of pain and releases Theo\\'s neck. Theo GASPS for air. JUNIOR You didn\\'t play fair. (stands up) You were almost blue. Theo gets his fingers in a bowling ball and brings it up to bash Junior in the head. JUNIOR Go ahead Theo, I saw you on TV. I\\'m your biggest fan. Junior offers Theo his unprotected head. JUNIOR (yelling) Come on Theo, GIVE ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH! Theo bashes Junior in the head with the ball. It bounces off Junior\\'s head like a Nerf ball and rolls down the alley. JUNIOR Thank you, Mr. Skinner! Thank you! Theo desperately, but fruitlessly tries to get away. As he crawls over the ball return trough, Junior puts his foot on Theo\\'s head. JUNIOR I can have her,you know. (looks around and whispers) She\\'s not my real sister. (he flashes a lecherous smile) THEO\\'S POV A ball pops up at the far end of the return and TRUNDLES rapidly towards Theo. The ball hits Theo\\'s face with a POW. BLACK OUT We HEAR \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.\" THEO\\'S BOWLING SHOE ATTIRED FEET Being dragged down the lane. Theo comes to and looks down his body to see the empty lane. He looks up to see Junior pulling him towards the pin reset machine. The cut on Theo\\'s forehead bleeds down the side of his face. JUNIOR (muttering) Lubrication. MACHINE NUMBER 6 Junior pulls the dazed Theo into the pin-reset machine and positions him under the pins. As Junior prepares the machinery, a control cable on his claw becomes fouled. Junior begins to thrash about as he tries to disentangle himself and his malfunctioning arm. Theo rolls away as Junior\\'s flailing releases the machine. It comes slamming down on Junior just as Theo slips out of harm\\'s way. He gets up and staggers away from the machine. Junior\\'s HOWL echoes across the lanes. His twitching feet protrude from the maw of the device. Lane six goes dark. Theo limps up the lane. CUT TO: 64 EXT. BRIDGE 64 Theo drives up to the erect draw-bridge. He stops and gets out. The night is silent. THEO (loud whisper) Sheila! Where are you? Sheila pops out of the bushes and walks towards Theo. THEO (angry) You told Junior that we did it. SHEILA It? THEO It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer. SHEILA I told him you were my boyfriend. THEO (very pissed off) What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven\\'t even gotten naked yet! SHEILA We would have sooner or later. THEO Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you. SHEILA Did you - kill him? Theo paces up and down in front of the upright bridge. THEO How do you get this thing down? SHEILA Tell me what happened Theo. Theo backs Sheila towards the bridge control booth. THEO (glares at Sheila) You wanted me to kill him, didn\\'t you? SHEILA (in shock) If he\\'s not dead, he\\'ll keep coming back. THEO He\\'s dead Sheila. SHEILA I feel sick. THEO You should. SHEILA Are you sure he\\'s dead? THEO I didn\\'t stop to take his pulse. Theo boosts Sheila up the ladder to the control booth. The hydraulic machinery of the bridge heaves into motion and the bridge begins to lower. Theo walks over to his car. Sheila jumps down from the bridge control booth and follows him. SHEILA Where are you going? THEO I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car. SHEILA Can I come with you? THEO I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel. CUT TO: 65 INT. THEO\\'S CAR - NIGHT 65 Theo grips the steering wheel with white knuckles. He nods off at the wheel, the roadway through his eyes wavering and distorting. He hits himself in the face in an effort to keep himself awake. 66 INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE - NIGHTMARE 66 The house is dark except for a light coming from the closed bathroom door. Theo cautiously makes his way to the door. THEO (whispers) Buzz? You alright? WATER is running inside. Theo twists the doorknob and opens the door with a jolt. Junior lunges out of the dark, mangled and bloody with bowling pins sticking out of his chest. JUNIOR Don\\'t you KNOCK? Theo SLAMS the door shut. 67 EXT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE - DAWN 67 Theo jerks awake. His car is parked by the Fazeli house. It is a clear, blustery day. A gust of wind pulls the screen door open, then SLAMS it shut. He gets out of the car and walks unsteadily towards the house. 68 INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 68 Theo walks into the house. The place is completely trashed. Theo picks up a golf ball from the floor. He makes his way to the bathroom door and slowly turns the knob; then pulls back. He picks up a nearby bowling ball and holds it over his head as he reaches for the doorknob. This time, he thrusts the door open. The bathroom is empty. Relieved, he cradles the ball in his arms. BALL Thick crimson red fluid trickles down his forearm, dripping off his elbow. Horrified, he pulls his fingers out of the ball. Blood streams out of the three finger holes. He drops the ball to the floor. He goes into the bathroom and turns on the sink faucets. INT. BUZZ\\'S HOUSE, BATHROOM Water runs as Theo manically washes the blood from his hands and arms. He rinses the blood from the holes of his ball and looks up to the mirror. \"NOK NOK\" is smeared in blood across his reflection. 69 EXT. 7-ELEVEN PHONE BOOTH - DAY 69 Theo waits through several rings. GRACE Hello? THEO Hello, mom? GRACE Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright? THEO I found dad. GRACE He\\'s dead, isn\\'t he. (pauses) Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born. THEO Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late. GRACE You sure you\\'re OK Teddy? You\\'re not bowling are you? THEO I gotta go. Love ya mom. Theo hangs up the phone. Alfie shuffles over. ALFIE Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out. THEO (stunned) The pin machine? ALFIE Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All\\'s I know is it\\'s gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away. 70 EXT. MILES \\'O\\' LANES 70 Theo pulls into the parking lot. The place is cordoned off with day-glo yellow emergency tape printed with \"Bowling Police - Do Not Cross\". A black bowling police van, its blue light spinning, is parked in front. Bowling cops herd dwarfs and customers into the van. Mothers and daughters mill around behind the yellow tape. A group of little people brandish \"Right to Work\" signs. Theo gets out of his car. The crowd moves in as Kastle, hands cuffed behind him, emerges from the door. LITTLE GIRL There he is! Camera flashes POP all over the place. Two black-jacketed bowling cops step out behind him. They are Sid and Breeze. BREEZE Bowling police, step back, give him room. SID Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball. LITTLE GIRL Mr. Kastle, we know you wouldn\\'t do anything bad. KASTLE Thank-you, sweetheart. (turns to Breeze) See that you pinheads! Character witness. (with sweeping head gesture) They\\'re all character witnesses! (he sees Theo) Thanks to Buzz Fazeli, bowling is dead in this town! He KILLED it! The two officers hustle Kastle towards the van. Theo steps out in front of him. KASTLE (between clenched teeth) You fool, we could have done great things together! THEO Where\\'s Junior? KASTLE He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he\\'s gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd\\'s MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder. KASTLE (shouting) Lock your daughters up, ladies! Junior\\'s out there! Mothers and daughters send out a cacophony of screams and scatter for their cars. The BP cops hoist Kastle into the back of the van. Sid slams the doors shut. The van screeches off, sirens wailing. Sid and Breeze walk up to Theo. BREEZE Sorry about your loss. THEO (shaking his head) I should\\'ve pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one. SID You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health. THEO So, Buzz was stooling for you guys. SID You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo\\'s car. BREEZE Did you know you were parked in the handicap space? SID Kastle\\'s daughter\\'s been lookin\\' for you. Theo gets into his car and starts the engine. Sid and Breeze poke their heads in the windows. SID She told us you went after Junior to save your old man\\'s hide. You got some balls goin\\' after that psycho. BREEZE Only problem is, you didn\\'t put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out. SID Think he bought it? BREEZE I\\'d buy it! Sid chews his lip worriedly. 71 INT. THEO\\'S CAR - AFTERNOON 71 Theo nods off for a second and then snaps back. His eyes seem hypnotized by the lines on the road which seem to swim and undulate unnaturally. He nods again. And snaps again. 72 EXT. PARKING FIELD - TWILIGHT 72 Theo pulls up to the old party spot and gets out. He walks over the dunes and towards the beached station wagon. A huge flame rises down the beach. A woman is visible in its light, tossing objects into the fire. Theo walks towards her. EXT. BEACH, BONFIRE Sheila is stripping Barbie and Ken dolls and tossing them onto the pyre. Each one goes up in an exaggerated WHOOSH of flames. She notices Theo when he steps into the light. SHEILA Once my father walked in on me while I was making Barbie and Ken do it. He freaked. I was seven. He took all my dolls away from me and cut them in half. He gave the top halves back to (more) SHEILA me. Then he made me watch him burn the bottom halves in the fireplace. Theo kneels down nearby and throws a Barbie onto the bonfire. It goes up with a WHOOSH. SHEILA I can see Junior\\'s face in the fire. Theo puts his hand on Sheila\\'s hand. She looks at him. SHEILA Why did you come back? THEO When I\\'m with you Sheila, I don\\'t even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously. SHEILA If Junior finds us, he\\'ll kill us both. THEO I killed him once, I\\'ll just have to kill him again. SHEILA You don\\'t get two chances with Junior. THEO At least I\\'ll die smiling. Sheila pushes him over. He falls backwards, her on top. SHEILA And you only get two chances with me. Sheila yanks her shirt over her head and tosses it away. FIRE The shirt CRACKLES and burns. She pulls Theo\\'s head up to her breasts. SHEILA What\\'s it gonna be, Theo? A Barbie\\'s breasts blister from the heat. THEO & SHEILA Theo bends Sheila backwards, down on her back. She grabs the tail of his shirt, yanks it over his head and off his body. Sheila rubs her hands up Theo\\'s back. SHEILA What\\'s the plan, Theo? A Ken back bubbles and melts. Theo lifts Sheila\\'s back off the sand and works her jeans down her legs. SHEILA Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll\\'s legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila\\'s eyes. THEO Plan C. From now on it\\'s gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others\\' sweaty skin. THEO It\\'s gonna be you, Sheila. They humpty-hump to the beat of \"Scientist\\'s\" \\'DEMATERIALIZE.\\' We hear Theo and Sheila\\'s stereophonic MOANING as a Barbie and a Ken doll collapse and vaporize from the blazing heat. We pan up through the flames, the MOANS increasing in volume and intensity as they reach the you-know-what-we\\'ve-all-been- waiting-for. CUT TO: 73 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 73 A coffin moves slowly forward as a solemn DIRGE plays. The top is in the shape of a bowling alley with a miniature black bowling ball inscribed with \"The Faz\" at the head. The pallbearers; Theo, Breeze, Sid, Tina, and two other bowlers place the coffin on poles above the grave. A rotund priest sprinkles holy water. Sheila stands next to Theo, crying. (more) Theo wears a glazed look. The priest clears his throat with a loud AHEM. PRIEST (with pomp and vigor) Bowling! (pauses to reflect) Bowling is a little like faith. Every now and then, we are blessed with the ability and strength to send a full roller down.. (makes bowling gesture) ...and scatter those babies like nobody\\'s business. And every now and then we end up in the gutter. (pauses and gets glum) Buzz Fazeli found himself in the gutter of life. Trapped in hook alley, throwing nothing balls. But before he left us for that pie alley in the clouds, he pulled himself out of that gutter. Buzz Fazeli died cleaning up the sport of bowling. Now he lies at peace alongside his lane brothers here in Bowlers\\' Field. (makes sign of the cross) He died so that we could bowl - with dignity. Millie, decked out in mourning black, lets out a wail, steps up and throws a bouquet of flowers onto the coffin. MILLIE (sniffles) I forgive you Buzz. Sid leans over to Theo. SID (in loud whisper) The Faz sure took care a her. (points to Millie, does the cash rub with fingers) Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid. BREEZE Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz. SID See ya \\'round Faz. Tina steps up to the grave with a handful of papers. TINA These are all your perfect games. (she drops scoresheets onto the coffin) Bowl with God, Buzz. Mourners sniff and cry. The coffin starts descending into the ground. A stiff breeze scatters the scoresheets. Sheila nudges Theo who approaches and tosses a handful of soil into the grave. THEO Maybe you were right Buzz. Maybe I did just come here to take it out on somebody. But, I had to find my father... The muffled BEEPING of \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\" begins playing from inside the coffin. Theo\\'s body jolts. He runs after Sheila who is walking towards her scooter. THEO Buzz is alive, Sheila. The two sleazeballs gaze surreptitiously at him as they walk towards their car. Theo grabs Sheila\\'s jacket. SHEILA Theo, Buzz is dead. THEO I didn\\'t come this far to bury a guy that\\'s not my dad. He owes me. SHEILA (bitterly) Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila. SHEILA I\\'ve been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it. SHEILA Now he\\'s the one who\\'s locked up and I\\'m the one who\\'s free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out. THEO (yells) SSHHEEIILLAAA! 74 EXT. CEMETERY PARKING LOT 74 As Sid and Breeze walk up to their car, Theo catches up with them. THEO Why is Junior\\'s watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here. SID Your time is up, busyboy. THEO Who identified the body? SID The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality. THEO I\\'m the next of kin. I should\\'ve seen him. BREEZE After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed. THEO You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior\\'s underground in that coffin you dicks put him in. BREEZE It\\'s splitsville for you. Sid and Breeze back away from Theo. THEO You faked my dad\\'s murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls. SID Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I\\'d be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of \"New York Bowler\" from his pocket. The headline reads \"RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN\" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli. SID It\\'s official, you\\'re an orphan. Happy now, busyboy? Theo stares at the newspaper. He lets Sid\\'s fingers drop. 75 EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 75 Sheila speeds along, her Vespa maxing out at 30 mph. From behind her we see Theo\\'s car approaching rapidly. He pulls up beside her. THEO (shouting and pointing frantically) What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh? SHEILA Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he\\'s probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again. THEO You\\'re really pissing me off. SHEILA I\\'m pissing you off? I\\'m doing what I said I\\'d do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word? THEO My word is good, and it\\'ll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you? SHEILA What about plan C? THEO Fuck plan C! SHEILA Your word is so good, you\\'re never gonna give it to anyone. THEO You think I\\'m dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who\\'s dumping who? SHEILA I\\'m not dumping you, I\\'m suspending you. THEO Sez you! SHEILA Suck my dick! She speeds ahead. 76 EXT. HIGHWAY 76 Theo THUNDERS along in his car. He listens to his SONG over the stereo. Theo digs into his pocket and pulls out the golf ball from Buzz\\'s house. 77 GOLF BALL 77 The logo on the ball reads \"PARADISE.\" THEO Paradise. The white ball fills the frame. THEO (OS) (whispers to himself) Paradise. Hmmmm The camera pulls back from the ball to reveal: 78 INT. TROPICAL 7-ELEVEN - DAY 78 Theo standing in flowery long Bermuda shorts, matching airbrush Luau shirt and 7-11 shades. The woman behind the counter looks like Alfie\\'s twin. (It\\'s actually Alfie in drag.) It\\'s the same store as before, only with a tropical motif. Instead of bowling magazines on the rack, there\\'s Mini- Golf Digest. ALFREDA examines the ball at arm\\'s length, through her bifocals. ALFREDA You a mini-golfer? THEO Nope. ALFREDA Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave. ALFREDA Can I get you something for the road? THEO You have orange whips? ALFREDA Orange who? Not from \\'round here, are ya? THEO No. I\\'m from Akron. 79 EXT. BILLBOARD - DAY 79 The billboard fills the frame. It reads \"Paradise Putt-Putt\", and underneath: \"A heavenly experience.\" A motorized cheesy- looking smiling dwarf-angel swings a golden club. EXT. MINI-GOLF COURSE Miniature golf obstacles are bathed in the light of the setting sun. The camera passes a huge cement centaur surrounded by astro-carpeting. WOMAN (OS) I just hold it loosely with both hands? MAN (OS) That\\'s right, sugar, find the grip that\\'s right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green. WOMAN (OS) Grasp firmly. Then what? MAN (OS) Line up where you want it. WOMAN (OS) Yeah. MAN (OS) Now swing it out a little to the right... WOMAN (OS) Like this? MAN (OS) No, no, that\\'s too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It\\'s all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman. His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it. WOMAN Strokin\\'. Here goes nothin\\'. She swings a club, sending a golf ball puttering into a cup. MAN Hole in one! You\\'re the queen of stroke! WOMAN Yippy! Theo strides towards the couple. The man under the halo is (more) Buzz. He raises the club at the approaching Theo, keeping the woman in front of him as a shield. The front of Buzz\\'s cap reads \"I\\'m No Angel.\" BUZZ Get away from me! WOMAN Who the hell are you? THEO Hi Dad. WOMAN Dad? You said you was single. BUZZ We ain\\'t married no more. THEO He says that to all his wives. As she tries to wiggle away from him, the club conks Buzz on the noodle, squishing his halo. WOMAN (freeing herself - to Buzz) Geez Maynard, is he telling the truth? BUZZ Don\\'t pay him any mind, sweetheart. WOMAN You\\'re a nice guy, Maynard, but if you got two wives - I ain\\'t into no polybigamy. Buzz is silent. He takes the club out of her hand. She steps away - startled - then turns and jogs away. Buzz throws down his club in a fury. BUZZ Goddam it! I was just about to make a love connection. You sure got a way with women. You show up, women get away. THEO (laughs) The whole world thinks you\\'re underground. BUZZ I am underground. Buzz removes his damaged cap. THEO It could just as easily have been me in that box. BUZZ I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo. THEO What about bowling? BUZZ (takes a practice swing) Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I\\'m a living dead legend. I\\'m a hero. THEO You\\'re a scumbag. Buzz pats his hair down and slips the cap back on his head. BUZZ I\\'m a live scumbag. Theo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball. He tosses it to Buzz. THEO Nice knowing you, dad. Theo turns and walks towards his car. Buzz pauses and walks after him. BUZZ So, eh, you never saw me. Right? THEO I never saw you. BUZZ Thanks, kid. (pause) Where are you goin\\' now? THEO I\\'m goin\\' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window. BUZZ Listen, if straight doesn\\'t work out, you come work for me. (hands Theo his card) Just make sure nobody\\'s following you. Buzz\\'s face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze. BUZZ I didn\\'t mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I\\'m glad I didn\\'t have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen. BUZZ (hands the card back) You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call. (taps the card) Tell him your Maynard\\'s boy. He\\'s expecting you, and he owes me. He\\'ll getcha back in like Flynn. (pats Theo\\'s cheek) Don\\'t say I never gave you nothing. THEO (cracks a half smile) See ya \\'round Maynard. Buzz backs away from the car as Theo peels out in reverse. Buzz stands and watches as Theo pulls away. 80 EXT. MILES \\'O\\' LANES PARKING LOT - DAY 80 The sign has been changed to \"SHEILA\\'S ALLEY.\" A sparkling new badass super-chromed Vespa is parked in the handicap zone. The Barbie and Ken dolls are wired to the headlamp. They look incredibly worse for the wear. A parking ticket is nestled between them. Theo\\'s car pulls in nearby. 81 INT. SHEILA\\'S ALLEY 81 Theo walks through the doors and into the alley packed with serious bowling types. As he walks towards the back of the alley, several bowlers stop bowling and stare at him in awe. LUNA Theo! Howya doin\\'? Theo walks on. Others greet the conquering hero. BOWLER Theo! Hey, Theo\\'s back! TINA Hello there, stranger. LITTLE GIRL (still crying) Waaaaaaaaaaah! At the far end, we see Sheila, dressed in a fitted jogging suit, bowling alone on her lane. Bowlers stop and hold their balls at their sides. Sheila notices the whole alley is silent. Theo steps up to the lane, bowling ball bag in hand. As he straps on his wristbrace he peers down the lane and sees a seven-ten split; mule ears. CUT TO: 82 BLACKNESS 82 A loud ZIP and light spills in through three holes. Three fingers approach the holes, blocking out the light once more. With a POP, the fingers leave the holes and the ball hits the lane with a KLUNK. LANE The camera races towards the pins along the maple boards. PINS Two pins loom in the foreground, one at each edge of the screen. The ball slams into the right hand pin in super slow motion with a ROAR. Theo\\'s eyes slowly close. The pin lifts and hurtles slowly across the frame towards its unsuspecting fellow pin. Theo\\'s eyes open. With a reverberating EXPLOSION, the pin is taken out. 83 INT. SHEILA\\'S ALLEY, THEO & SHEILA 83 Theo turns to Sheila and takes her in his arms. SHEILA Very professional. THEO I am a professional man. SHEILA (touches his lips) Lips still for sale? THEO (nonchalantly) You bet. For five bucks, I\\'ll even throw in the tongue. SHEILA (she pulls away, slightly) Can you change something this big? She pulls out a hundred dollar bill. THEO I don\\'t know. Sheila stuffs the bill down Theo\\'s pants. SHEILA You\\'ll owe me. They smooch big time. One by one, balls drop to the lanes again and pins start CRASHING. DISSOLVE TO: 84 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 84 Alfie, hands trembling, lays a tiny wreath on Buzz Fazeli\\'s grave. The headstone reads, \"Maynard \\'Buzz\\' Fazeli \\'I Never Met A Bowler I Didn\\'t Like.\\'\" A muffled watch beeper CHIMES \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.\" The camera pulls up to show ten headstones laid out in a bowling pin set-up with Buzz\\'s at the head. DISSOLVE TO: 85 EXT. MINI-GOLF COURSE 85 Buzz\\'s silhouette against an orange sunburst sky. He wears his halo hat. He takes a beautiful PGA-perfect slow motion fluid golf swing, connecting with a THWAP. As he follows through, divots of turf dance at his feet. MUSIC swells. He holds the afterswing pose and gazes after the ball, off into the distance. FADE OUT'],\n",
