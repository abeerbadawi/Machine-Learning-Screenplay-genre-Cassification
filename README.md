# Machine-Learning-Screenplay-genre-cCassification
In this work, we develop an algorithm to read the screenplays and automatically predict the genre of the movie. 

1. We design the algorithm, and propose a solution to create training data

2. We propose an evaluation metric and evaluate the result of your algorithm with the proposed metric.


The repository includes:

1. Final.ipynb includes the code and detail explanation for each line in the code

2. pickled_scripts_and_labels.p includes the scripts and genres label as a pickle file

3. pickled_preprocessed_scripts.p includes the scripts after the preprocessing as a pickle file

4. Results for classification by each genre: Includes a CSV file with Accuracy, recall, and precision of classification  the data by genre as the predicting label to predict if scripts are correctly classified in the right genre or not.

5. Results for classification by each movie: In this file, we classify by each movie to predict all the genres for the movie. The file includes a text file with the correctly predicted movies with all genres and a confusion matrix of the algorithm results.
